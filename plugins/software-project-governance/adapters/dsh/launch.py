"""DeepSeek Harness adapter launcher for software-project-governance.

Unlike the other adapters, whose launchers only print the manifest,
dsh has a real install surface: an agent preset is a plain directory under
``${DSH_HOME}/.agent-presets/<id>/`` holding ``agent.cordis.yml`` +
``preset.yml``. This launcher RENDERS the composition template (substituting
the ``__GOVERNANCE_*__`` tokens with absolute paths) into that directory, and,
optionally, writes the DSH project bootstrap (``AGENTS.md``) into a governed
project root.

Single source (FIX-310 / DEC-187, 2026-09-12): the package's preset payload is
``agent-presets/governance/`` and holds exactly two files — the composition
template ``agent.cordis.yml.template`` (the ONE composition source) and
``preset.yml``. Nothing is duplicated: ``skills/``, ``commands/`` and
``agents/`` stay the repository's shared core, referenced ABSOLUTELY from the
rendered file. ``lib/index.js`` ``ensurePreset()`` renders the identical
composition automatically on bundle boot; this launcher is the manual /
offline path (the reference bundle ships ``install.ps1`` / ``install.sh`` for
the same purpose). Both renderers share the same declared token contract, so
they cannot disagree; ``adapters/dsh/agent.cordis.yml.template`` used to carry
that template and now lives inside the preset payload it renders.

Modes:
  --check              Print the adapter manifest summary (default action).
  --install / --sync   (Re)write the preset into ${DSH_HOME}/.agent-presets/governance
                       by rendering ``agent-presets/governance/agent.cordis.yml.template``
                       (staging directory + rename, so a crash mid-render never
                       leaves a half-written preset). Isolated environments
                       only: the write side refuses the real home (exit 2),
                       and the post-`git pull` refresh of the real user
                       preset is a dsh restart, which re-renders it by
                       package version.
  --uninstall          Remove the governance preset — deletes exactly
                       ${DSH_HOME}/.agent-presets/governance/ and nothing else
                       (sibling presets and every other file under DSH_HOME
                       untouched; path-escape guard built in). Idempotent: a
                       missing preset is a clean no-op. This is the official
                       preset-side uninstall path — `dsh plugin remove` manages
                       the profile's pnpm bundle layer, never the user preset
                       root, so it cannot remove this preset.
  --dry-run            Safety mode (FEAT-010 incident / DEC-158 R1 protocol):
                       print the resolved ${DSH_HOME} and every planned write
                       without touching the filesystem. Verify the adapter this
                       way, or against a redirected DSH_HOME — never by
                       installing into the real ~/.dsh.
  --smoke              Isolated preset-session smoke gate (FEAT-015 /
                       RISK-049 ②): render the preset under a REDIRECTED
                       DSH_HOME and prove the session loading surface — the
                       skill catalog root (skills/software-project-governance/
                       SKILL.md) and the /governance gesture projection
                       (adapters/dsh/skill-shims/governance.md →
                       commands/governance.md). Exit 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL,
                       2 = REFUSED. The guard refuses to run when DSH_HOME is
                       unset or resolves to (or around) the real ${HOME}/.dsh,
                       and the real home is fingerprinted before/after
                       (metadata only) so a write would be detected.
                       Resolution-level only: it never claims LLM session
                       behavior (printed as NOT_RUN).
  --bootstrap-project DIR [--force]
                       Write the DSH AGENTS.md bootstrap into DIR (thin
                       pointer; it must not duplicate workflow rules). Refuses
                       to overwrite an existing different AGENTS.md without
                       --force.

The rendered composition never needs the file sandbox: it only reads the
repository's shared skills tree and points agents at scripts under this
repository. It registers no services, so the dsh mount audit accepts it from
any user preset root.

#
# RISK-049 closure standard (2): "安装后 preset 会话可用" must become a
# repeatable machine gate instead of reasoning. The smoke generates the preset
# under a REDIRECTED DSH_HOME (M7.7 protection baseline (a) — isolation) and
# resolves the two loading surfaces a session needs:
#   1. the skill catalog root (skills/software-project-governance/SKILL.md),
#   2. the /governance gesture projection (skill-shims/governance.md → the
#      shared commands/governance.md it points at).
# Both surfaces are checked for the INSTALLED preset (generated into the
# redirected home) and for the SHIPPED in-package preset (baseUrl
# self-location — the FIX-290 regression surface).
#
# Isolation is structural, not advisory: the guard REFUSES to run unless
# DSH_HOME is redirected away from the real home (unset, or resolving to /
# above / inside ${HOME}/.dsh is rejected before any write), and the real home
# is fingerprinted before/after (metadata only — no file content is read, so
# credentials are never touched) so any write would be detected and FAIL.
#
# Resolution-level by design: this proves the composition a session mounts
# carries the catalog and the gesture. It does NOT run an LLM session and
# prints that boundary as NOT_RUN instead of implying it.

    reproducing on a second) is a host race → **advisory, not FAIL**; the write
    surface has no such tolerance.

    ``resample`` — when given, it is called at most once to take the second
    post-sample **only if** a top-level delta was suspected (the sampling
    moment is "immediately after the first post-sample, interval 0"); the delta

    Reproduced-ness is judged **against the baseline**, not against the first

    ``renders_to``). Asserting it keeps that declaration load-bearing while the

    payload is held to the one declared form.

    ``stage`` selects the form the entries must match, because the declaration
    describes two ends of one substitution:

      * ``"template"`` — the render source, whose entries are declared tokens
        (``entry_form``);
      * ``"rendered"`` — the mounted composition, whose entries are either the
