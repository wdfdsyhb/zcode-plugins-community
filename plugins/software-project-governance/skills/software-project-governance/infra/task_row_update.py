"""task-row-update — the single governed write path for plan-tracker task rows.

Batch-1 ticket 1 of version-plan-0.86.0 §2 (FEAT-051, formerly FEAT-042R —
the ``R`` suffix violated PREFIX-NNN so the number was re-sequenced).  This is
the termination surface of boundary-audit B-1: the recurring hand-edited row
incidents (3+1 confirmed during REL-082 planning, 7 by the end of the
planning session) are replaced by one CLI that is the *only* supported way to
flip a task row's state, machine-anchored by task id instead of a human
counting pipe characters.

Consumes the m0-r1 frozen contract (``infra/contracts.py``) **read-only**:
the seven TASK_STATES, the 11-edge TASK_TRANSITIONS table, the three-valued
operation-replay decision, the WriterRequest/WriterResult CAS shapes and the
closed error-code enum.  This module never mutates contract objects — pinned
by ``test_contract_objects_are_consumed_read_only``.

Design sources (quoted, not re-derived here):

  * arch round-2 §1 — the five-step write flow (LLM submits → CLI takes the
    short-term lock → re-read + re-validate (CAS / lock ownership / legality)
    → compute + atomic replace → release and return new revision + result
    code); CAS and the short-term lock are *combined*, not alternatives.
  * arch round-3 P1-1 — M0 freezes the cross-ticket interface, not the
    writer's internal details; per-writer calibration lives here.
  * evolution §4 — the nine-item machine-writer DoD this module implements.

Public entry points:

    main(argv)          CLI handler (self-contained; ``python task_row_update.py
                        ...`` works, and the dotted path ``task_row_update.main``
                        is the composition-root assembly point in the
                        governance_cost / bootstrap_aggregate pattern)
    cmd_task_row_update(args)
                        engine dispatch face (wired by the batch-2.0
                        integration slice, FEAT-055): consumes the engine's
                        parsed Namespace, no argv re-parse
    add_arguments(parser)
                        module-owned option fact source (single definition
                        shared by ``main`` and the engine subparser)
    execute_update(...) library entry (the five-step flow, returns WriterResult)
    inspect_target(...) read-only observation surface (CAS expectation source)

Registering the subcommand follows the engine-wires-dispatch-only pattern
(governance_cost, bootstrap_aggregate): this module contains zero ``import
verify_workflow`` (ArchGuard R2), is stdlib-only at import time plus the L0
``contracts`` leaf, and exposes a dotted-path handler a composition root can
assemble on demand.  The engine dispatch row itself lives outside this
ticket's frozen two-file surface and is wired by the batch-2.0 integration
slice (disclosed in the delivery report, never silently assumed).

operation_id scope declaration (P3 carry-over from FEAT-049 review R0 —
batch-2.0 obligation discharged here, in prose, because the frozen
WriterRequest shape cannot grow fields inside an implementation ticket):

  * **Generation scope: global** (contract face 1) — ids are minted via
    :func:`contracts.new_operation_id` (``op-`` + uuid4 hex); nothing here
    narrows or renames that form.
  * **Resolution scope: the target file's ledger.**  Replay/conflict
    adjudication consults the sidecar ledger bound to the file being written
    (``<target>.ops.jsonl``).  Under the "one canonical source per table —
    never dual masters" invariant (arch round-2 §6) the takeover range of
    0.86.0 is a single governed table with one ledger instance, so the
    per-file resolution scope is the *only* scope in which a retried
    operation can legitimately arrive.  A global cross-ledger duplicate index
    is deliberately out of scope here — it belongs to the batch-2.1 closure
    event-log slice, which already owns a durable operation journal.  A
    duplicate id arriving at a *different* ledger resolves to ``execute``
    there (each ledger only knows its own history); this boundary is
    disclosed rather than hidden.

schema_version carrier declaration (P3 carry-over — batch-2.0 obligation):

  The frozen WriterRequest has no ``schema_version`` field and this ticket
  must not grow contract shapes.  The carrier is therefore **CLI-side**:
  ``--schema-version`` (default 1) is validated against
  ``SCHEMA_VERSION_WINDOW`` (:class:`contracts.SchemaVersionWindow`) — a
  version outside ``[minimum, current]`` is refused with
  ``schema_version_unsupported`` (旧 CLI 遇新 schema 拒写), and the accepted
  value is stamped onto every receipt row in the ledger.  The record-family
  schema versioned here is "markdown pipe-table task row, status column =
  last cell, STATE_MARKERS vocabulary, v1".  If batch 2.0 needs the field on
  WriterRequest itself, that is a contract change (propose → re-baseline M0 →
  identify affected tickets → re-run acceptance), never an edit here.

Idempotency is effect-based (``contracts.IDEMPOTENCY_MODEL``): the ledger is
consulted for *adjudication*, but the world is re-read under the lock for
*truth*.  A retried operation whose receipt was lost (crash between the
atomic replace and the ledger append — the one effect-first window, disclosed
in ``RECOVERY`` below) is NOT silently re-executed: the state-level CAS sees
the row already at the target state and refuses with ``revision_conflict``,
pointing at the out-of-band reconciliation.  The log alone never decides what
happened.

Machine provenance marking (DoD 9): every flipped row carries its operation
id appended to the status cell (`` 〔op-<32hex>〕``), so the written line is
self-identifying on its face, and every write additionally produces a
structured receipt row in the ledger (task_id / operation_id / before-after
states / timestamp / row + file fingerprints) — the structural-join anchor.
Enforcement posture is **WARN** (per the ticket: this ticket only *produces*
the credential; the join/enforcement check surface lands in batch 2.3).

Supported platforms for reliable persistence (DoD 3): Windows NTFS and
POSIX — temp file is created in the target's own directory (same volume, so
``os.replace`` is atomic there), UTF-8 **without** BOM, and the original
file's line-ending style (LF vs CRLF) is preserved byte-for-byte on every
untouched line.

Recovery (``RECOVERY``, DoD 6):

  * Before the atomic replace, any failure leaves the target file untouched
    and the temp file is removed in a ``finally`` block — no half-written
    target is ever observable, and stale ``*.tmp`` siblings from an earlier
    hard kill are swept at the start of the next run.
  * ``os.replace`` is the commit point.  After it, the target is complete.
  * The one effect-first window: crash after the replace but before the
    ledger append.  The world has the effect, the ledger lacks the receipt.
    Recovery is effect-based and manual-adjudicated, never automatic
    re-execution: retrying the same operation id hits the state-level CAS
    (row already at target) → ``revision_conflict`` with detail
    ``effect_present_without_receipt`` — reconcile the row content against
    the request fingerprint by hand, then record the adjudication.  This
    module deliberately does not auto-forge the missing receipt (a writer
    that fabricates its own audit trail is worse than an honest gap).
  * The lock file itself is left in place (loop_event_log precedent) to avoid
    a create/delete race; only its byte-range lease is transient.

         ``lock_contention`` (retryable), never an unlocked write.
      3. **Re-read + re-validate** — under the lock: replay adjudication
         (ledger + fingerprint → execute/replay/conflict), transition
         legality (contract TASK_TRANSITIONS via
         :func:`contracts.require_task_transition`), row anchoring by id,
         state-level CAS (detected row state must equal ``from_state``) and
         the optional content-level CAS (``expected_revision`` against the
         freshly observed aggregate revision).
      4. **Compute + atomic replace** — :func:`build_candidate_row` (marker
         swap + provenance suffix), full-content reassembly preserving every
         other byte and the file's line-ending style, then
         :func:`_atomic_write` (commit point).
      5. **Release + return new revision + result code** — receipt appended
         to the ledger under the same lock, write-after re-read self-check
         against the same parsing schema, lock released, WriterResult
         (``ok``, new aggregate revision, execution ``succeeded``).

    Fails closed before any external action on validation/conflict/retryable
    codes (``execution`` stays ``None`` per the frozen WriterResult law);
    ``manual_intervention`` is reserved for post-commit I/O damage where the
    world already changed.

         governed writer (the B-1 hand-edit class) and is never re-anchored;
      3. stale progress phrases are cleared from the paren-free span
         before the anchor (:func:`_refresh_progress_prefix`); the
         committed token, the date/narrative parentheses, the anchor's

         anchor-prefix scope as the stale refresh);

         names its most recent writer operation — same discipline as a
         flip); the post-refresh row must STILL detect as ``committed``.

    terminal state, so there is no transition to validate — the pre-flight
    instead proves the row IS terminal (chain-first ``committed`` + exactly
    one ops anchor) and carries at least one misalignment: a stale
    progress phrase (FIX-394) and/or a bare ``committed`` token missing
    its ✅ completion marker (FIX-422 — the pre-fix canonical rendering).
    A row with neither resolves to ``ok`` with nothing written and no
    receipt (an honest no-effect operation records no effect); a retried
    operation id replays the original result exactly like a flip.

    The receipt carries ``action=REFRESH_ACTION``, the removed phrase
    list and the FIX-422 ``completion_marker_restored`` flag, so the ops
    ledger can audit exactly what wording the alignment cleared and
    whether the terminal token was re-rendered to the completion-marker
