"""FEAT-046 — governed writer family for the machine-record store (batch 1).

Three command families over the same governed-write pipeline (version-plan
0.86.0 §2 批 1 / boundary-audit B-3 + B-5 + B-2):

    locks-extend     TTL 延展 for existing ``agent-locks.json`` entries
    locks-amend      field/file amendments for existing dispatch locks
    locks-release    task-anchored release: the active_tasks entry AND every
                     file lock owned by the task (FIX-370 / B-10)
    evidence-append  machine EVD row append into ``evidence-log.md``
    decision-append  machine DEC row append — dual-backend since FEAT-061
                     (md ``decision-log.md`` under MD_ACTIVE authority /
                     ``decision-store.json`` under JSON_ACTIVE authority;
                     routed by the persisted authority marker)

(locks-extend / locks-amend / locks-release are one family over the same
acquire-pipeline schema; evidence-append / decision-append share the append
pipeline.)

Root causes closed here (0.86.0-boundary-audit.md):

  * B-3 — ``acquire_dispatch_locks`` covers acquisition only; every TTL
    extension / file addition was a hand edit of ``agent-locks.json``
    (4 live schema incidents in the 2026-09-19 session).  Both commands
    here reuse the ACQUIRE pipeline's schema semantics (Check 26 field
    shape ``locked_by`` / ``locked_at`` / ``ttl_seconds`` / ``ttl_reason``,
    optional ``expected_new``) — no second schema is defined.
  * B-5 — every hand-written EVD row was an unschema'd structural
    operation (×415 legacy column-drift WARN baseline).  ``evidence-append``
    enforces the skeleton mechanically and stays OUT of content semantics
    (W-4): no keyword / whitelist / opinion scanning — the narrative is the
    caller's judgment (J10); only the mechanical skeleton is judged.
  * B-2 — decision rows had no writer at all (one truncation incident,
    FIX-312 exposure).  ``decision-append`` is the minimal governed append.

Contract consumption (M0 frozen revision ``m0-r1``, READ-ONLY — the change
rule in ``infra/fixtures/m0/manifest.json`` applies to any extension):

  * face 1  ``operation_id`` — ``new_operation_id`` / ``require_operation_id``
    / ``decide_operation_replay`` power the retry protocol;
  * face 3  ``ERROR_CODE_DISPOSITIONS`` — every refusal reports a closed
    error code + disposition class;
  * face 4  ``SchemaVersionWindow`` — rows carry ``schema v1``; unknown
    newer schemas are refused, never guessed;
  * face 5  ``WriterResult`` / ``EvidenceRef`` / ``EVIDENCE_REF_KINDS`` /
    ``REFERENCE_VALIDATION_STATES`` / ``IDEMPOTENCY_MODEL`` — structured
    results and the typed reference machine-check.
    ``reference_validation`` is deliberately SEPARATE from any verdict
    (arch round-2 §3): this CLI reports resolvability only; whether
    evidence is SUFFICIENT stays a human/LLM verdict and is never derived
    from file existence.

DoD ten items (0.86.0-architecture-evolution.md §4, items 0–9) mapping:

  0 model output untrusted — every string argument is type/shape checked;
    ``git_object`` values are form-validated before any subprocess; URL
    refs are syntax-checked and NEVER fetched (no network).
  1 pre-write full validation — the candidate row is fully built and
    validated (shape + IDs + refs + cross-record ID continuity) before the
    target is opened for writing.
  2 idempotency/conflict — same operation_id + same payload returns the
    recorded result (replay, never re-append); same id + different payload
    is refused (``operation_id_conflict``).  Idempotency is effect-based
    (查世界不信日志, ``IDEMPOTENCY_MODEL``): appends recover by locating the
    operation marker in the target file (world, not log); locks resume by
    comparing the world against the recorded target/baseline state.
  3 reliable persistence — explicit UTF-8 (no BOM), same-directory temp
    file + ``os.replace`` (atomic), original line endings and the original
    byte prefix preserved.
  4 post-write reread — the same validator re-parses the written row (no
    second schema definition) and the pre-write byte prefix is compared
    (a mismatch is disclosed, never auto-restored).
  5 dry-run + structured results — ``--dry-run`` renders the exact row and
    the full validation result while writing NOTHING; refusals carry the
    closed code + disposition (validation / conflict / retryable / manual).
  6 recovery — a crash between the target write and the ledger write is
    recovered by the effect-based replay above; locks operations record a
    pending-effects ledger entry (target + baseline) so a re-run either
    completes, re-applies from an unchanged baseline, or refuses as
    ``manual_intervention`` — never double-applies.
  7 guard tests — column-shape refusal / per-kind missing-ref refusal /
    same-op replay / concurrent appends (threading) / GBK + CJK payload /
    markdown pipe special characters / legacy ×415 rows untouched.
  8 progressive adoption — this module is opt-in: nothing in the engine
    routes through it, and the fallback is the pre-existing path (direct
    CLI / manual edit), not a schema relaxation.
  9 machine provenance — every machine-written row self-identifies
    (``机器写入：governance-store <command> <operation_id>`` marker in the
    basis cell; actor cell ``governance-store``).

Registration face (组合根装配 — wired by FEAT-055, 0.86.0 batch 2.0): the
four writer commands are now engine-dispatched (`registry._COMMANDS` +
verify_workflow main(); FEAT-020 frozen face re-baselined 88 → 95 keys in
the same change).  The module keeps its own composition root (``COMMANDS`` +
:func:`main`) so ``python governance_store.py <command> …`` keeps working —
both paths share one option fact source (``add_*_arguments``) and one
Namespace executor (``cmd_*``, FEAT-047 P2-1 caliber — no argv re-parse).

Batch-2.0 disclosure obligations discharged here (review-FEAT-046-CODE-R0
P3-2/P3-3, FEAT-055):

  * **Stale-lock takeover (P3-2)** — a lockfile older than
    ``_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS`` (600s) is unlinked and taken over by the next
    acquirer.  Reachable only when one holder is pathologically slow (>600s
    for a single-file atomic write); the disclosed cost is a transient
    mutual-exclusion erosion (a stale holder that eventually finishes will
    not unlink its successor's lock — it no longer owns ``_acquired``).
  * **New .governance artifacts have no check coverage (P3-2)** —
    ``governance-store-ops.json`` (the operation ledger) and
    ``.governance-store-locks/`` (the lockfile dir) are read/written only by
    this module; no verify_workflow check guards them yet.  Unbounded ledger
    growth is registered as BT-4 (evolution §5); a structural check is a
    later-slice candidate, not silently assumed.
  * **governance_id matching is mention-level (P3-3)** —
    ``_validate_governance_id`` searches hot files and the archive with a
    ``\b``-delimited substring match, NOT row-anchored: a typo'd mention in
    prose is enough to report ``resolvable``.  Under the resolvability-only
    contract this cannot fabricate a verdict (validation ≠ sufficiency),
    and row-anchored matching is deferred deliberately — tightening it
    would change the resolvable face of existing legitimate references.

×415 legacy policy (arch round-2 §3): legacy rows are a legacy batch —
read-safety only; this writer constrains NEW rows and never rewrites or
re-judges existing content.

Zero injection surface: subprocess use is one argv-list ``git rev-parse
--verify`` on a form-validated value; no shell, no network, no templated
commands.  Cells containing a raw ``|`` or a newline are REFUSED (they
would change the column shape); the refusal message documents the two
safe spellings (inline-code span, full-width ｜).

#:     Every triageable task id is therefore addressable as a

#:     machine-check rejects its family" gap for the 13 task prefixes the

#:     only: no previously resolvable ref changes meaning — a ref to an
#:     id genuinely absent from the tracker still reports unresolvable.
#:   * RECORD families (rows live in the other hot files) — kept
#:     explicit: these are record registries, not task ids, and are
#:     deliberately NOT part of the task-family vocabulary.
#: Ad-hoc prefixes outside BOTH layers (the M-2 ``MES-001`` incident)
#: remain unknown-family refusals.  The triage-side entry gate itself
#: (shape-only ``PREFIX-NNN`` validation in change_triage.py, both the

#: constraining it to the task-family vocabulary is a behavior change
