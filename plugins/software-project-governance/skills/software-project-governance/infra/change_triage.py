"""Change-control triage engine + machine record writer — FIX-237.4 / ADR-017 §4.4.

FEAT-013 / RISK-046 adds the dispatch-lock write API
(:func:`acquire_dispatch_locks` + :func:`agent_locks_acquire_cli`): the
Coordinator's ``agent-locks.json`` acquisition is machine-validated at
write time — pre-write path existence (a lock may not target a
nonexistent file unless declared ``expected_new``), and a same-day
change-triage ``files`` cross-check (mismatch = disclosed WARN, never
blocking). Hand-assembling dispatch locks is the RISK-046 drift root
cause; the write API is the root-cause fix.

The ``change-triage`` CLI (verify_workflow.py thin entry) delegates here. A
new **product-code** task MUST complete the mandatory five-step triage before
it is created in plan-tracker:

  a. **dependency analysis** — runs task-priority-analysis
     (:mod:`task_priority` parse + compute) and snapshots the full tool
     output (rendered text + JSON report) into the triage record;
  b. **priority determination** — P0/P1/P2 with in-flight task counts and
     the version-chain context from the plan-tracker roadmap;
  c. **conflict check** — same-file overlap with in-flight tasks (the
     existing triage records are the machine registry of in-flight file
     sets; completed tasks never conflict);
  d. **version adaptation** — target version validated against the project's
     current version (the plan-tracker roadmap's highest released row;
     FIX-288 two-layer semantics — never the workflow/plugin version) and
     the planned-next version in the roadmap;
  e. **execution side-effect declaration** (FIX-271 / AUDIT-146 §7.2 R2) —
     any outside-repo side effect implied by the task's ``files`` /
     rationale / acceptance (installer execution, real profile writes,
     network publishing) MUST be declared (``declared_side_effects``:
     side-effect surface + blast radius); a user-real-environment touch
     auto-attaches the R1 (one-of-three) review condition; an undeclared
     detectable side effect records a WARN issue (advisory — never
     silent, never blocking). The step lands in the record as the purely
     additive ``analysis.side_effect`` field.

Behavior contract (ADR-017 §4.4 / FIX-237.4 / DEC-139):

  - **Fail-closed intake**: an unknown task-family dependency, a priority
    outside P0/P1/P2, an empty ``files`` list, a target version lower than
    the current version, a new-task dependency cycle, or a malformed task id
    produces NO record and a non-zero CLI exit — the task cannot be created
    without a triage record. Step-e WARN issues are advisory (exit 0) —
    the WARN lives in the CLI output and the machine record.
  - **Machine record**: ``.governance/change-triage/{TASK_ID}.json`` holds
    the five-step analysis + the ``task-priority-analysis`` snapshot
    (``report_json`` + ``report_text``); an evidence-log row (id
    ``TRIAGE-{TASK_ID}``) is appended at the same time. The evidence-log
    call snapshot contract = the JSON command output stored in the record
    (FIX-237.5).
  - **Schema stability (FIX-271)**: ``TRIAGE_SCHEMA_VERSION`` stays 1 —
    step e is a purely additive optional field (``analysis.side_effect``)
    appended after the four existing step keys; no reader (Check 32
    validates the four required steps only) rejects unknown analysis
    fields, so existing records and consumers stay byte/shape compatible.
  - **Single record per task (FIX-247)**: re-triaging an already-recorded
    task id is rejected (fail-closed) — the machine record is immutable and
    a duplicate would self-conflict plus double the evidence row.
  - **Best-effort all-or-nothing (FIX-247)**: the record and its evidence
    row are written record-first, then evidence row. If the evidence append
    fails after the record write, the record is rolled back so no
    half-written triage remains; true cross-file atomicity is not achievable
    without a journal, so a rollback that itself fails leaves the record
    behind (residual risk, reported via the returned ``error``).
  - **Quick lane boundary (FIX-228)**: only ``.governance/`` governance
    record changes may skip triage; any new task touching product code
    (skills/**, agents/**, infra/**, commands/**, ...) MUST run the standard
    path. Check 32 (checks.triage_domain) enforces the record requirement.
  - **Cycle tolerance (FIX-237.2/237.3)**: existing graph cycles are WARN
    (snapshotted, never blocking). A cycle CREATED BY the new task itself is
    fail-closed.
  - **Purity contract**: analysis helpers perform no file I/O and no
    side effects; all I/O lives in :func:`run_triage` /
    :func:`load_triage_records` / :func:`acquire_dispatch_locks` /
    :func:`agent_locks_acquire_cli` (FEAT-013 dispatch-lock writer — the
    same machine-write discipline as the triage record). The module
    imports only the standard library + :mod:`task_priority` (peer, pure).

    Scans the triage inputs (``files`` / rationale / acceptance wording)
    for outside-repo side-effect signals:

      - a file outside the repository (absolute path, UNC /
        single-backslash root, ``~``, ``$VAR``, ``%VAR%``, parent escape)
        is an outside-repo side effect — BOTH the raw string and its
        normalized (backslash → slash) form participate in this judgement
        (FIX-273 P2-1), so no rendering of the same path escapes
        classification. Home-tree / env-var targets additionally count as
        a user REAL-environment touch;

        outside-repo side effect even when properly isolated (R5 standard
        wording「隔离环境安装冒烟…临时目录…」stays NON-real-env).

    **Wording-detection limitation (FIX-273 P2-2)** — the wording signal is
    context-blind by design: it does NOT parse negation or quotation, so a
    banned-word substring triggers in ANY context (e.g. 「禁止修改
    %USERPROFILE%」, or quoting R5 rule text, still classifies as a

    intentionally unchanged and a negation-window / quote-aware pass is a

    wording-based.

    """FEAT-013 — machine dispatch-lock acquisition with write-time checks.

    RISK-046 root cause: the Coordinator hand-assembled
    ``agent-locks.json`` with no write-time validation, so a typo'd /
    placeholder / not-yet-created path entered ``file_locks`` directly
    (a lock on a nonexistent file protects nothing once the real file
    appears), and the lock set could drift from the same-day triage
    record's ``files``. This API is the only sanctioned acquisition path
    (CLI ``agent-locks-acquire``; the dispatch template forbids
    hand-writing the lock file).

    Validation order (fail-closed — NOTHING is written on any error):

      1. task id shape (``PREFIX-NNN``), non-empty file list,
         ``expected_new`` ⊆ ``files``, positive integer TTL;
      2. the existing lock file must be structurally sane (valid JSON,
         dict ``active_tasks`` / ``file_locks``) — a corrupt file is
         never merged into;
      3. duplicate-task guard — the task must not already hold an
         active lock (release first, M7.6a);
      4. cross-task conflict guard — a target already locked by another
         active task is refused (the writer never creates the
         ``multi_lock_conflict`` Check 26 flags as BLOCKING);
      5. **face 1** path existence — every target must be an existing
         file under ``repo_root`` unless declared in ``expected_new``
         (the pre-created-file exemption, persisted as
         ``expected_new: true`` on that lock entry);
      6. **face 2** same-day cross-check — a ``files`` mismatch against
         the same-day triage record is a WARN in the returned summary
         (disclosed by the CLI on stderr; NEVER blocking: triage
         precedes the lock and the lock may legitimately carry
         dispatch-preauthorized extensions — the drift must be SEEN).

    Args:
        task_id: dispatch task id (PREFIX-NNN).
        files: repo-relative lock targets (backslashes normalized).
        expected_new: subset of ``files`` the task will create (not on
            disk yet) — the RISK-046 ① exemption channel.
        agent_role / coordinator_session / description: active_tasks
            entry metadata (Check 26 required fields included).
        ttl_seconds / ttl_reason: file_locks TTL fields.
        governance_dir: ``.governance`` directory (locks + triage
            records live under it).
        repo_root: base for existence checks (default: cwd).
        now: injectable clock (tests); default ``datetime.now()``.
        locks_path: explicit lock-file override (tests).

    Returns:
        dict summary (``locks_path`` / ``lock_files`` / ``expected_new``
        / ``cross_check`` / ``warnings`` / ``written``); ``error`` key

    ``demand_source``, ``user-named`` without ``demand_basis``,
    ``user-named`` below the P1 floor) returns ``{"error": ...}`` and writes
    NOTHING — no record, no evidence row. Step-e (side-effect) issues are
    WARN (advisory): they land in the record and the summary but never
    block (WARN 起步，不得静默).

    demand_source intake (FEAT-077 / ADR-021 §2.2.1):

      - three-value closed enum ``user-named`` / ``active-defect`` /
        ``machine-signal``, normalized case-insensitively; an explicit
        non-enum value → ``{"error": ...}`` zero-write (the CLI thin entry
        maps it to exit 2);
      - ``user-named`` REQUIRES ``demand_basis`` (溯源依据：用户原话/DEC
        引用/活性缺陷证据锚 — 防 BC-4 出身洗白：user-named 判定必须可追溯);
      - ``user-named`` enforces a P1 priority floor (P2+user-named →
        rejected, FEAT-077 task rule: 用户点名需求被 P2 顺延即倒挂入口 —
        NOTE: ADR-021 §2.2.1 carries no such clause; reported to the
        Coordinator as an ADR gap pending amendment);
      - **窗口协议（Coordinator R0 P1-2 裁定；窗口已随 FEAT-080/B3 关闭，
        DEC-290(5)）**: the parameter is OPTIONAL with the conservative
        default ``machine-signal`` — the historical B2→B3 window shape
        (the then-locked CLI call site could not pass the flag). FEAT-080
        wired ``--demand-source`` as required at the argparse layer, so
        the CLI path can no longer reach this default; it is retained for
        direct library callers only and still grants no unearned
        tie-break rank (machine-signal ranks last, ADR-021 §2.2.2 D1).

    Args:
        task_id: new task id (PREFIX-NNN).
        title: one-line task title.
        priority: proposed priority (P0/P1/P2).
        target_version: target version (semver or unversioned marker).
        depends_on: iterable of task-family dependency IDs.
        files: product files the task will modify (MUST be non-empty for
            product-code tasks; quick-lane .governance/-only work does not
            use this command).
        reason: triage rationale (priority determination context).
        acceptance: acceptance-criteria text — step-e input for R5 wording
            detection (FIX-271 / AUDIT-146 §7.2 R2/R5).
        declared_side_effects: side-effect declaration (surface + blast
            radius) — satisfies the step-e declaration duty for
            outside-repo side effects (R2).
        demand_source: provenance of the demand (ADR-021 §2.2.1 three-value
            enum, case-insensitive; see the intake rules above).
        demand_basis: traceability basis for ``user-named`` (REQUIRED when
            demand_source=user-named).
        plan_tracker_text: raw plan-tracker markdown.
        current_version: the PROJECT's current version — the plan-tracker
            roadmap's highest released row
            (:func:`derive_project_current_version`; FIX-288 two-layer
            semantics — not the workflow/plugin version).
        governance_dir: ``.governance`` directory (records land under
            ``governance_dir/change-triage/``).
        existing_records: optional pre-loaded triage records (defaults to
            :func:`load_triage_records`).
        records_dir / evidence_path: explicit overrides for tests.

    Returns:
        dict summary (record_path, evidence_row_written, analysis,
        snapshot_ref, wiring-free). ``error`` key present on fail-closed
        input. Never raises.

    FIX-417: the intake validation, the record assembly, and the
    record+evidence write/rollback are extracted to _intake_demand_source /
    _build_triage_record / _write_triage_record; this function keeps the
    five-step analysis flow.
