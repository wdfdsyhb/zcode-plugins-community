"""Risk-domain checks — extracted from verify_workflow.py in 0.70.0.

Scope (DEC-083 Phase 5b / ADR-016 / FEAT-009): the risk-staleness check
(Check 2) and risk-escalation check (Check 8), plus their risk-only parsing
helpers (`parse_open_risks`, `_parse_context_open_risks`), and the
REQ-145.3 / FIX-265 mitigation-closure watchdog
(`check_risk_mitigation_closure`, Check 36).

This module owns the risk check domain. Shared helpers and constants still
defined in verify_workflow.py (`RISK_PATH`, `_context_file`, `_context_task`,
`_governance_table_cells`) are reached through a deferred module reference
rather than a top-level import, so verify_workflow.py can import this module
at module load time without an import cycle.

Functions with cross-domain callers (`_risk_status_is_closed` is used by the
release-blockers check; `_check_risk_has_closed` is used by gate auto-judge)
STAY in verify_workflow.py and are reached via the deferred accessor — they
are not duplicated here (ADR-016 §3.2 / §4.3 KEEP rule).

See docs/architecture/ADR-016-verify-phase5-extraction-0.70.0.md for the
design and the line-number baseline used during extraction.
