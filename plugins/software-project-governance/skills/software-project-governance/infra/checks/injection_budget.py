"""FEAT-039 / AUDIT-154 slice A-8 — injection-size budget gate.

AUDIT-154 §5 ("诉点 3"): the workflow ships quality gates but owns no budget
gate for its OWN injected surfaces — "预算不守护则瘦身必然回弹" (a slimming
pass with no guard rebounds). This module prices the ACTUAL LOADED SET, i.e. a
multi-file SUM over the surfaces a session really carries, so splitting a
surface across files can never evade the budget.

Four measurement decisions, each deliberate:

1. **Tokenizer (documented approximation — no external tokenizer dependency).**
   The host already prices context with a fixed-density heuristic
   (``@deepseek-ai/dsh-token-meter``: ``ceil(chars / 4)``); the report quotes it
   as ``tokens_host`` so the numbers stay comparable with DSH's own accounting.
   The BUDGET uses a three-class calibration instead: one token per CJK
   character, the host's 4-chars-per-token (rounded up) for ASCII, and 0.4
   token per non-CJK/non-ASCII character. A real BPE tokenizer spends ≈1 token
   per Han character, so pricing Chinese at 4 chars/token would under-report
   3-4x — blind exactly where the cost lives. Both numbers are reported per
   surface; only the calibrated one is budgeted.

2. **Canonical sources (not the dogfood instances) — one boundary definition.**
   Entry surfaces are priced from the ``governance-init.md`` Step 7 templates —
   the generation source ``check-entry-bootstrap-sync`` already guards — so the
   gate cannot be moved by editing one workspace's entry file. Live workspaces
   stay out of the budget (``check-entry-bootstrap-sync`` owns that consistency
   face). The block boundary is not re-derived here either: the slice is
   delegated to ``sync_entry_projection``, the module that renders the platform
   entry files, so the price and the shipped text cannot disagree (R1 of
   review-FEAT-039: a private boundary rule priced trailing spec prose into the
   thin pointer and kept the markdown fence markup in every template).

3. **Tiers.** ``resident`` = the static set injected before any user
   interaction (persona + the selected entry template + the dual-entry thin
   pointer + the agent-instructions payload); ``skill`` / ``command`` =
   on-demand progressive loads, measured for visibility but never summed into
   the resident number (AUDIT-154 §8 keeps the static budget separate from the
   bootstrap / tool-return budget, which FEAT-033 already enforces at 8192
   bytes — registered here rather than re-implemented).

4. **Hard gate (FEAT-050, DEC-211③ — slice-A window closed).** The threshold
   is 6K tokens (arch target: 4K). The slice-A advisory window existed because
   the standard/strict entry templates exceeded 6K; the FEAT-041 slimming pass
   brought all three profiles under it (EVD-1104 baseline: lightweight 4,216 /
   standard 5,694 / strict 5,966), so an over-budget resident set is now an
   issue + FAIL — future growth fails closed instead of rebounding silently.
   The ``skill``/``command`` tiers stay report-only and are NOT folded into
   the resident gate here. The skill tier carries its OWN budget line
   (16,000 tokens — FEAT-052): the measured baseline is 14,456 tokens, the
   deliberate growth of FEAT-041's progressive-disclosure migration, so the
   independent budget is data on the policy row (``budget_tokens`` beside the
   explicit ``report-only`` gate) — the posture does not move; flipping it to
   ``hard`` is a 0.86.0+ candidate to be carried via FEAT-047's
   BaselineMetadata, not by this table.

Layer placement: this is a measurement + render leaf (``checks`` package), not
engine code. The ArchGuard ratchet forbids growing the engine's own LOC and
print calls, so the engine keeps only dispatch wiring (``bootstrap_aggregate``
and ``checks.projection`` precedent).
