"""M2 discovery-closure loop gate processor — ADR-021 §3.2.1 (FEAT-081 B4).

NAMING NOTE (acceptance 5, FEAT-081): the ``loop`` in this module's name
is the **discovery→closure loop** of ADR-021 M2 / DEC-286(6) 「发现即闭环」
(the governance contract), NOT the Loop-engineering PARO runtime of
ADR-014/FEAT-006 — that domain lives in ``infra/loop_gate_processor.py``
(a different package level; imports are package-qualified so the two never
shadow). Nothing here activates, schedules or orchestrates any runtime:
this module is a deterministic word-set detector plus ledger bookkeeping.

The three pieces (ADR-021 §3.2.1, spec-literal):

  1. **face-5 词集** — ``DEFERRED_LITERAL_WORDS`` + ``DEFERRED_PATTERN_WORDS``
     (first-version word set, tunable from ledger data — RT-5);
  2. **否定语境窗口** — a hit whose preceding 8 characters contain one of
     废除/禁止/违规/=/不得 does NOT fire (quoting a rule while negating it
     ≠ performing the behavior; this window is the double-insurance layer
     over the family exemptions, ADR §3.2.1 fourth element);
  3. **三键台账** — every word-set hit on an in-scope added row is bucketed
     by ``命中词 × 行族 × 否定语境命中(bool)`` in the guard-owned
     observation ledger; the bucket summary is the false-positive-rate
     report data the WARN→FAIL flip decision owes before entering
     decision-log (RT-5: 给「数据回流调词集」一个容器).

Row-family scope (ADR §3.2.1, D3 豁免清单): ``evidence`` (EVD- rows) and
``task_status`` (plan-tracker task rows) are judged; ``decision`` (DEC-
rows), ``review`` (REVIEW- machine rows) and ``ops_ledger`` receipts are
exempt — a DEC quoting 「登记待以后」 records a governance fact, it does
not perform the behavior.

Posture (ADR §3.2.1 姿态): **WARN first, 渐进 FAIL** — the flip goes
through decision-log with the ledger-derived false-positive report, never
silently. ``DEFERRED_REGISTRATION_POSTURE`` is that first-version posture
constant; a detector-side error is fail-closed *disclosure* (the engine
emits a loud WARN-class issue, never a silent skip — ADR §2.4 L4).

SKIP 语义分态 (CR-R1-2, FEAT-081): ``classify_observation_face`` keeps the
two SKIP kinds distinguishable and attributed — ``vacuum`` (nothing to
observe: no problems raised, no deferrals, no anomaly) versus
``orchestration_fallback`` (the detection/collection orchestration could
not do its job — ledger unreadable/corrupt, row-family read failure); a
fallback is disclosed, never reported as a measured vacuum, and any
deferred signal suppresses SKIP entirely (the rate-zeroing path).

Purity contract (provenance_domain discipline): stdlib only; this module
NEVER imports ``verify_workflow`` — the engine consumes the domain, never
the reverse. No I/O lives here: ledger appends (writes) stay with the
engine, while ledger reads live in the shared leaf
``provenance_domain.read_deferred_ledger_events`` (FEAT-083), which
reuses this module's pure parsers via a function-local import.
