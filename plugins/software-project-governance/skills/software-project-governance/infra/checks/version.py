# ── Static version pin scan (DEC-213③ / FIX-361) ────────────────────────────
# M-1 caliber blind spot, rule-ized: release-time test pins (FIX-352/353) were
# found by hand for the fifth consecutive time — no machine face intercepted
# NEW static pins of the active version inside infra/tests.
#
# Judgement semantics (minimal, auditable): a test-file line is a "static
# version pin" when it carries a standalone semver token equal to the CURRENT
# active version (SKILL.md frontmatter — the same authority the rest of this
# module reads) on a line that can actually execute or feed data. Pure `#`
# comment lines and docstrings are annotations — they cannot turn a suite red
# on a bump — so they are skipped (docstrings detected via ast; string CONTENT
# lines that merely start with `#`, e.g. fixture markdown headings, stay
# scanned). This captures the pre-fix defect shapes verbatim (FIX-352
# assertion argument string; FIX-353 module-level fixture head string) while
# synthetic versions (9.9.9), historical references (0.83.0 after the bump),
# and future targets (0.85.0 today) never equal the active version and pass.
# At the next bump today's future targets become equal and surface as WARN —
# derive them or exempt them then.
#
# Posture: WARN-only disclosure (0.85.0 conservative close; FAIL escalation
# is a later ruling). Findings name file:line plus the suggested derivation.
#
# Exemptions (FIX-354-style auditable ledger): synthetic fixture data and
# version-pair test inputs that legitimately mention the active version live
# in STATIC_PIN_EXEMPTIONS as (line, token, reason) rows. The token anchors a
# row to its line's content: an entry whose line no longer carries the token
# (drift or removal) is reported as a stale-exemption warning, so the ledger
# cannot rot into a blanket allow.
