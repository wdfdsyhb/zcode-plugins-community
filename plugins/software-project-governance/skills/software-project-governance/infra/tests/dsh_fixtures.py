"""Deterministic fixture emitter for the dsh dependency-boundary slices.

FEAT-029 (0.81.0 slice V1), design §5.4 / §6.1 V1⑥ / §7.3:

    python skills/software-project-governance/infra/tests/dsh_fixtures.py \
        --emit-fixture FX-NO-SCHEMA-01 --out <dir>

writes ``<dir>/FX-NO-SCHEMA-01.cordis.yml`` and **the same fixture id produces
byte-identical output on every machine** — that is what makes the acceptance
commands of V3/V4/V5 self-contained instead of depending on a hand-built
composition (§4.4.1⑤ R0 F-11).

Shape of the module:

  * ``FIXTURES`` — id → ``(filename, builder)`` for the fixtures whose bytes are
    fully determined by repository sources today: they are *text mutations* of
    the shipped composition template / patch layer, or minimal compositions
    built from row shapes already measured in AUDIT-153. No consumer behaviour
    is needed to produce them, which is why they belong to the data-layer slice.
  * ``DEFERRED`` — id → ``{slice, reason}`` for the fixtures of §5.6 whose
    bytes need a slice that has not landed yet (V2..V8). ``--emit-fixture``
    reports the owning slice instead of inventing content; the contract's
    ``coverage.entries[].negative_fixtures`` references stay closed over
    ``known_fixture_ids()`` = ``FIXTURES`` ∪ ``DEFERRED`` (§2.8 K-8).

Determinism rules (asserted by ``test_dsh_contract.py``):

  * input text is read as bytes and normalized CRLF → LF before mutation, so a
    checkout with ``core.autocrlf`` cannot change the output;
  * no timestamps, absolute paths, machine names or iteration-order-dependent
    construction enters the payload;
  * output is written as bytes (never through a text-mode newline translation)
    and is UTF-8 except where a fixture's *subject* is invalid UTF-8.
