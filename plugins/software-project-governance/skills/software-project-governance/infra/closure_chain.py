"""closure-chain — the pure sequence orchestrator for one standard closure
(M3 vertical slice, version-plan-0.86.0 §2 batch 2.1/2.2, FEAT-056).

Design sources (quoted constraints, not re-derived here):

  * arch round-2 §2 — forward recovery (断点续传/幂等重入), NO cross-git/push
    rollback; the recovery rule table (evidence 已写 tracker 未更新 → 复用原
    evidence ID 续; commit 成功状态未落盘 → 核验目标不重复提交; push 凭据失效
    → blocked+诊断等凭据修复; push 结果不明 → 先核远端再决定); the
    persistence checklist (closure_id / 输入摘要 / 已完成步骤及产物 ID /
    失败原因重试条件 / 外部动作结果不明标 UNKNOWN); the self-reference trap
    (「push 成功的状态记录」不入其描述的 commit — closure 运行状态与业务记录
    分离); the event carrier ruling (复用既有 loop 事件协议/持久化机器,
    不默认塞同一日志文件 — 独立 closure 日志分域).
  * arch round-3 BT-9 — chaos kill semantics: 子进程写入器 + 父进程测试控制
    器 + 命名故障点; no TTY, no SIGKILL constant (Popen.kill() cross-platform);
    hard-terminate vs raise-exception are SEPARATE test classes; kill ≠ 掉电/
    存储故障持久性保证; **the injection interface lives in internal test
    entry points only and is never exposed on the production CLI**.
  * BT-7 (evolution §5) — the chain engine itself carries ZERO business
    logic: a chain is a declared step sequence, each step invoking an
    existing governed CLI (task-row-update / evidence-append /
    decision-append / locks-amend ...).  The kill-switch (DoD 8) is the
    fallback to the per-step M7.4 protocol: every step's command runs
    standalone; engine removal degrades to atomic CLIs, never to hand
    edits.
  * evolution §2.1 — effect-based resume (查世界不信日志): resume probes the
    world (row flipped? evidence present? locks released?) BEFORE re-running a
    step; the log is audit + recovery context, never the truth source.
  * contracts m0-r1 (read-only) — EXECUTION_RESULTS (succeeded/failed/
    unknown), ERROR_CODE_DISPOSITIONS, SchemaVersionWindow, operation-id
    form, IDEMPOTENCY_MODEL = "effect_based".

What this module IS:

  * a declarative chain runner: step kinds ``cli`` (governed writer CLI),
    ``external`` (declared outside-the-chain action, used by fixtures/tests
    only in 0.86.0 — commit/push stay OUT of the production standard chain),
    ``summary`` (engine-computed ready-to-commit endpoint);
  * a closure event journal on its OWN domain file
    (``<root>/.governance/closure-events.jsonl``) built on the
    ``loop_event_log`` module machine — append/read/monotonicity are the
    reused primitives (zero second implementation of the persistence
    machine); the closure event types/fields are domain-owned per the
    round-2 carving (类型/schema 版本/closure_id/顺序号 分域);
  * effect probes (a small closed, read-only set) that let resume check the
    world first: task row state (via the writer's own ``--inspect``),
    operation-marker anchor in a target file, task dispatch-locks released
    (agent-locks ownership scan), git object existence / HEAD message
    (argv-list git, no shell), generic read-only command exit;
  * a ready-to-commit summary endpoint + ``--finalize`` explicit gate —
    git operations are NOT chain steps (权限语义不焊死进软件); ``--finalize``
    only VERIFIES the operator's commit exists (read-only) and records the
    fact; the closure journal artifacts are reported as ``do_not_stage``
    for the commit the summary describes (self-reference constraint).

What this module is NOT:

  * not a writer — it never parses or writes plan-tracker/evidence/decision
    content; every governed effect goes through the batch-1 writer CLIs as
    subprocesses;
  * not wired into the engine dispatch — standalone CLI only (``python
    closure_chain.py ...``), mirroring the writers' pre-FEAT-055 posture;
    engine wiring is a later-slice decision (frozen face stays untouched);
  * not a crash-durability oracle — BT-9 chaos tests prove kill+resume at
    protocol boundaries; they do NOT derive power-loss/storage-failure
    guarantees (round-3 verbatim).

Reliability posture (DoD, evolution §4, items 0-9): untrusted-input argv
substitution (lists only, no shell), pre-execution full spec validation,
deterministic per-step operation ids (stable across resume → writer-level
replay idempotency), loop_event_log append/re-read machine, dry-run +
structured results, resume/reconcile recovery (no hand-editable half
state), guard tests (concurrent resume, crash points, CJK payload, repeated
execution, torn journal line), progressive adoption (standalone opt-in,
kill-switch to per-step CLIs), machine provenance on every event
(``actor = "closure-chain/0.86.0-batch2"``).

Supported platforms (DoD 3): Windows NTFS + POSIX — persistence reuses
loop_event_log's append discipline (explicit UTF-8, single-write atomic
line, cross-process lock file); the run lock mirrors the
governance-store lockfile discipline (bounded acquire, hard refusal).

Fault injection (round-3 BT-9, TEST-ONLY — internal entry points): the
runner consults the ``CLOSURE_CHAIN_TEST_FAULT_POINTS`` environment
variable at named protocol-boundary fault points
(``post-step-effect:<step_id>``, ``post-finalize-verify``,
``post-generations-preread`` — the FEAT-063 takeover window between the
lock-out pre-read and the generations lock).  When set (by
the chaos test's parent controller, never by the production CLI), the child
process writes a handshake marker file and pauses until the parent kills
it (Popen.kill) or releases it.  No CLI flag exposes this surface.

Lock step (FEAT-065 — the FEAT-056 design point 5 registered gap is
CLOSED on the chain face, DEC-248 acceptance split): the governance_store
HAS the ``locks-release`` command (FIX-370) and the standard chain's lock
step is the task-scoped TRUE release through it — one governed write
removes the task's ``active_tasks`` entry AND every ``file_locks`` entry
with ``locked_by == task``, gated by the ``task_locks_released``
postcondition probe (an ownership scan that fails closed on an
unjudgeable locks world; a state observation that never substitutes for
the writer's receipt and never judges other tasks' locks). The
acquire-side TTL judgment face is FEAT-066's scope — untouched here.

Single-flight assumption (FEAT-056 R0 P3-4 disclosure, updated FEAT-063):
the per-closure run lock makes ONE closure id safe against concurrent
resumes, but it does NOT arbitrate two DIFFERENT closures driving the SAME
task in parallel — both would legitimately flip the same task row / append
their own evidence rows (evolution §6② registered 0.87 open question).
FEAT-063's execution-generation fence closes this shape FOR TASKS BOUND BY
A TAKEOVER RECORD (a non-holder closure refuses at the write-side entry/
step checks before any effect); for UNBOUND tasks (no record) the guardrail
still does not exist — operators MUST run one closure per task at a time
(单 closure 单飞), the chain neither detects nor prevents the
parallel-siblings shape there.

Release-window bootstrap (FIX-383, version-plan-0.88.0 §2 B2 — rollback
§8 #7 ⑩拆票之一): the release chain (M-1~M-8) depends on checkers/writers
whose OWN state can sit in an intermediate condition across a version
switch — the guard reconciliation baseline not re-generated, a
violation-ledger line-index drift (账本行号漂移), a guard state file whose
schema the current code no longer reads, or a pending FEAT-060 consumption
transaction.  The ``release-window-bootstrap`` built-in chain converges
exactly that world through ONE governed recovery action (verify_workflow
``write-guard-bootstrap`` — guard-owned artifacts only, zero
governance-record writes), reusing the FEAT-060 three-branch world-judged
transaction resume and the effect-based resume machinery above: the
step's read-only ``--check-only`` probe decides reconcile-vs-execute at
every run/resume boundary (查世界不信日志), so a mid-switch interruption
re-enters with zero manual repair; unjudgeable states halt loudly and are
never silently absorbed.

Cancellation vertical slice (FEAT-062, version-plan-0.88.0 §2 E1 — arch
Q5 minimal slice, rollback-0.86.0 §8 #5 清偿):

  ``cancel_closure`` / the ``cancel`` subcommand terminate a non-finalized
  closure with the restricted entry → CAS → writer-registered op →
  terminal semantics → own-locks-only release → reconciliation sequence:

  1. **Restricted entry** (限定入口): the closure must exist and sit in a
     cancellable state (``CANCELLABLE_STATUSES`` = running / blocked /
     awaiting-world-check / ready); ``finalized`` is an immutable
     terminal; an explicit ``authorized_by`` + single-line ``reason`` are
     required (the decision record needs both; newlines and raw ``|`` are
     refused at the zero-write gate — a pipe would make the DEC row
     deterministically unwritable and the leg permanently pending,
     review-FEAT-062-R0 F-1); steps whose effects are
     UNDETERMINED (``step_unknown`` / dangling ``step_started`` crash
     window) refuse — resume first to converge, then cancel; any
     external-step terminal event refuses (有副作用明确拒绝 — the outside
     effect needs human adjudication, the minimal slice never cancels
     across one).
  2. **CAS**: the per-closure run lock (the SAME lock run/finalize take)
     is the linearization point — a cancel racing finalize yields exactly
     ONE terminal event, the loser refuses; an optional
     ``--expect-status`` optimistic CAS refuses with ``revision_conflict``
     + the observed status (caller re-judges); the terminal append is one
     seq-continuous journal event under the lock. An in-flight chain holds
     the run lock → the cancel refuses ``lock_contention`` (retryable,
     zero changes) — the 在途写冲突 gate.
  3. **Cancellation op registration**: the DEC row is appended THROUGH the
     governed writer CLI (``governance_store decision-append``) — never a
     hand edit (FEAT-064 BLOCK family compliance: the decision row
     family's legal write path is the writer). The per-closure
     deterministic operation ids (``cancel_operation_id``) are the
     idempotency keys; the writer's pending→ok pipeline registers the
     cancellation ops in the ops ledger (可审计).
  4. **DEC/EVD/task terminal semantics** (终态语义): the DEC row records
     authorization + reason; EVD rows appended by the closure REMAIN
     (append-only audit, never erased); the task row is NOT modified by a
     cancellation — its current world state is disclosed read-only in the
     report (completed governed steps are retained effects, disclosed not
     reverted; a revert is a separate governed decision, out of the
     minimal slice).
  5. **Own locks only** (仅释放自有锁 — ARCH-09 same-type per DEC-237
     C1-ARCH-09): a FRESH world read of agent-locks.json decides whether
     the task still holds locks; release goes through the governed
     ``locks-release`` CLI (task-scoped: it removes the task's active
     entry and ONLY file locks whose ``locked_by == task``), so a lock
     whose ownership changed is never released by a stale cancel — a
     stale owner's cancel refuses without releasing the newer owner's
     state, exactly the decision_migration.cancel precedent.
  6. **Reconciliation** (closure 结果 + ops 对账): after the terminal
     event the report re-reads the journal, the ops ledger (read-only,
     fail-safe) and the locks world and reports per-leg states + a
     ``consistent`` verdict.

  Ordering discipline (中断恢复): the terminal journal event lands FIRST
  (one CAS append), then the two writer legs run with deterministic
  per-closure operation ids; a crash/refusal between legs leaves the
  closure terminal and the leg pending — re-running the SAME cancel
  command replays/applies the pending leg at the writer (same id + same
  payload → original result) and reconverges with zero manual repair.
  A replay cancel converges with the RECORDED intent from the journal
  (fresh CLI args are ignored, never re-recorded — the first
  authorization stands; review-FEAT-062-R0 F-5 wording). Resume of a
  cancelled closure is refused (terminal semantics); ``finalize`` of a
  cancelled closure is refused.

  F-5④ combination obligation (version-plan §3): the cancel's
  locks-release leg vs the write-guard's exclusive consumption right
  (FEAT-060/064) is exercised concurrently in the test suite — the cancel
  never touches the violations ledger (consumption stays the registered
  guard CLI's exclusive right), both writers serialize through the shared
  governance-store lock discipline, and both terminal states land exactly
  once.

  Reopen with attempt lineage + execution-generation fencing (FEAT-063,
  version-plan-0.88.0 §2 E2 — rollback-0.86.0 §8 #5 清偿后半):

  **Reopen (重开)**: ``reopen_closure`` / the ``reopen`` subcommand mints a
  successor closure for a TERMINAL closure (``REOPENABLE_STATUSES`` =
  cancelled / finalized) and records the lineage WITHOUT touching any
  original record (append-only audit — the original journal only GAINS
  one event):

  1. the original stays terminal (cancelled stays cancelled, finalized
     stays finalized — reopen never un-terminates; resume of the original
     keeps refusing; a reopen racing cancel/finalize serializes on the
     SAME per-closure run lock — the CAS point);
  2. the successor id is minted fresh; the ORIGINAL journal receives one
     seq-continuous ``closure_reopened`` event (successor id + attempt
     number + authorized_by + reason + prior_status); original records
     are zero-erased (审计链完整);
  3. SINGLE-SUCCESSOR lineage: a second ``reopen`` of the same closure
     refuses (``cross_record_violation``) naming the recorded successor —
     forking the attempt chain would corrupt the numbering; reopen the
     successor's terminal state instead (the chain deepens: attempt N+1);
  4. the successor binds the recorded linkage by running with
     ``--reopen-of <original>``: the run adopts the RECORDED successor id
     (a different ``--closure-id`` refuses — recorded intent stands, fresh
     ids never fork) and injects ``reopen_of``/``reopen_attempt`` into the
     chain inputs, so the successor's ``closure_started`` carries the
     back-link and the inputs digest binds it (a resume carries the same
     flag; conflicting fresh ``--input reopen_*`` values refuse);
  5. authorization discipline is the cancel gate's: ``authorized_by`` +
     ``reason`` required, single-line, no raw ``|`` (FEAT-062 zero-write
     field rules, shared helper).

  **Execution generation / fencing token (异常接管)** — FEAT-061 epoch
  fencing same-type, ARCH-09 owner-token discipline:
  ``takeover_execution`` / the ``takeover`` subcommand promotes the
  task's execution generation in ``.governance/closure-generations.json``
  (closure-domain sidecar; writer-family atomic replace — mkstemp +
  fsync + os.replace + dir fsync — under the generations lock, the
  promotion serialized against the prior holder's run lock AND
  re-validated in-lock: a prior holder that changed between the lock-out
  pre-read and the lock refuses ``lock_contention`` retryable with ZERO
  writes — the acquired run lock belonged to a former holder and the
  real one may be mid-flight, review-FEAT-063-R0 P0-1):
  generation N+1 binds ``--new-holder`` (a closure id). The WRITE SIDE
  enforces the fence (旧执行者恢复后不能继续提交 — 旧代际的写入被拒):

  * ``_run_locked`` re-checks the fence at entry AND before every
    executable step (the FEAT-061 in-lock revalidation shape: entry
    check + write-point re-check); ``finalize`` checks too;
  * a stale generation's run refuses ``revision_conflict`` (structured,
    ZERO effects — no probe, no subprocess, no bookkeeping) and records
    ONE idempotent ``closure_fenced`` audit event; a stale generation's
    ``finalize`` refuses the same way;
  * a stale generation's ``cancel`` still records its terminal + DEC row
    (termination is not submission) but its locks-release leg SKIPS
    (``skipped_fenced``) — a stale owner's cancel never releases the
    newer holder's dispatch locks (ARCH-09 same-type);
  * unbound tasks (no record) are unfenced — zero behavior change,
    backward compatible; an UNREADABLE record fails CLOSED (the
    authority is unjudgeable — repair or remove the sidecar to restore a
    judgeable world); ``--dry-run`` is a read-only proof and never
    fences.

  **Heartbeat semantics (如实 — the honest boundary)**: heartbeat timeout
  does NOT constitute a stop proof (心跳超时不构成停止证明). FEAT-044's
  round-heartbeat mechanism is E3, NOT this slice — this gate never
  reads any heartbeat/TTL as evidence of executor death. Takeover
  requires BOTH (a) explicit human authorization (``authorized_by`` +
  ``reason``, recorded) and (b) the prior holder's run lock being free
  (an in-flight chain refuses ``lock_contention``, retryable). Neither
  condition PROVES the prior executor is dead — they make the human's
  takeover decision explicit and serialize it against an in-flight run;
  the write-side fence is what actually protects the world if the
  judgment is wrong (the stale executor refuses loudly instead of
  writing). Under the run-lock discipline a mid-run fence is unreachable
  via the takeover path (the promotion holds the prior holder's run
  lock); the per-step re-check defends the out-of-band-edit residual and
  keeps the fence true at every write boundary.

  Journal version-aware reader (FIX-391 — REL-089 condition-③ closure
  ticket, DEC-241 附带裁定: the rollback runbook gate becomes CODE):

  The reader knows its own judgment surface — the closed event-type enum
  (``CLOSURE_EVENT_TYPES``) and the envelope schema window. A closure
  whose RAW journal carries an event type or ``schema_version`` outside
  that surface belongs to a NEWER writer; resuming/finalizing it from the
  kept (partial) view is exactly the measured misread vector — a newer
  writer's terminal looks like «active» here and the next append collides
  with an occupied seq. The gate:

    * PREFLIGHT over the COMPLETE raw journal BEFORE any recovery side
      effect (arch ① 预检模式 — «discover the unknown event halfway
      through» is not safe): every journal-consuming WRITE entry —
      run/resume (the ticket MUST), finalize, and the same-vector
      append/derive entries cancel + reopen — refuses ZERO-WRITE first
      (a conflicted journal never gains so much as an idempotent
      closure_fenced audit event from a reader that cannot judge it);
    * the refusal is a structured ``schema_violation`` payload naming
      the unknown types / foreign schema versions (machine-readable
      ``unknown_event_types`` / ``foreign_schema_versions`` lists — the
      per-closure inventory the runbook used to compile by hand);
    * READS stay fail-safe (读 fail-safe、写 fail-closed): status and the
      derivation faces keep disclosing via ``journal_problems`` and never
      gate on the conflict;
    * the writer carries an ANTI-OCCUPATION backstop (ticket
      acceptance — 碰撞向量被写入器侧防占用检查消除): an append whose
      target seq is already occupied in the raw journal raises — the
      collision is machine-impossible even for a path that forgets the
      gate;
    * the forged-tombstone discipline stands (DEC-241): no reader ever
      FABRICATES a known-type tombstone to defend an older reader (P1 /
      append-only) — a tombstone-shaped UNKNOWN event is simply refused:
      never honored as a terminal, never resumed across;
    * backward-compat matrix (tests, 红绿逐格): historical 8-type
      journals and current journals read/complete unchanged (the
      standard chain's lock-leg resume/finalize is NOT falsely
      rejected — arch ③ positive), unknown-type and out-of-window-schema
      journals refuse zero-write (arch ③ negative);
    * lock ownership (arch ②, pinned by tests): the per-closure run-lock
      FILE is never deleted and its byte-range lease is per-fd — after a
      new instance re-acquires the lock, a stale instance's release
      cannot disturb the new holder's lease (dispatch-lock ownership is
      pinned by the cancel locks-release tests: ownership-changed locks
      + skipped_fenced).

    Gates (zero-write refusals): task id + ``--new-holder`` closure-id
    form; ``authorized_by``/``reason`` (the FEAT-062 field discipline —
    explicit HUMAN authorization). The promotion serializes on (a) the
    generations record lock and (b) the PRIOR holder's per-closure run
    lock — an in-flight chain refuses ``lock_contention`` (retryable,
    zero changes), so a takeover never fences a run that is mid-flight.
    The in-lock re-read re-validates the prior holder against the world
    (review-FEAT-063-R0 P0-1): a holder that changed between the lock-out
    pre-read and the lock means the acquired run lock belonged to a

    E3, not this slice. The two conditions above make the human's
    takeover decision explicit and serialized; neither PROVES the prior
    executor is dead. If the judgment is wrong, the write-side fence
    protects the world: the "dead" executor's next run/step/finalize
    refuses ``revision_conflict`` loudly (and can be re-bound with
    another takeover) instead of writing through.
