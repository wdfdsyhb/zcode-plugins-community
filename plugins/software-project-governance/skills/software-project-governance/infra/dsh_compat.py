"""DSH preset composition ↔ INSTALLED harness schema compatibility guard.

Why this module exists
----------------------
A ``dsh`` upgrade silently invalidated one row of the shipped ``governance``
preset: the row carried the config key ``text`` while the upgraded
``@deepseek-ai/dsh-persona`` declares ``prefix: z.string().required()``. The
loader rejected the whole preset mount (``invalid config: $.prefix missing
required value``) and users could not start a session. Nothing in CI and
nothing in ``verify_workflow.py`` caught it, because every existing guard
either reads our own files or boots an isolated session — none of them
compares a composition row against the *installed* dsh's real schemas.

What it does (the loader's own code and decision rules, not a re-implementation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For every preset composition in the package it replays what the loader does,
using the loader's own code taken from the installed dsh:

1. parse the YAML with the loader's own dialect — ``entryListSchema`` from
   ``@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-include`` (js-yaml ``JSON_SCHEMA`` extended
   with a ``tag:yaml.org,2002:js`` scalar type producing ``{__jsExpr}``);
2. interpolate ``!!js`` nodes with the loader's own ``evaluate(ctx, expr)``
   (``new Function('ctx','expr','with (ctx) { return eval(expr) }')``) and a
   scope carrying ``baseUrl`` (the composition's own directory URL) plus
   ``process``/``console``;
3. decide who starts, as ``Entry._disabled`` / ``Entry.disabledOf`` do: a
   ``!!js`` node is evaluated (and may throw — the loader calls it unguarded),
   anything else is truthiness; a group row itself is always enabled, **but a
   group's own ``disabled`` is inherited by its children** through the loader's
   owning-parent walk, so those children are reported as not started rather
   than validated;
4. for every row that does start, resolve the row's module the way the loader
   and ``dsh-agent-presets`` resolve it (relative → beside the composition,
   bare package → from the resolved plugin plane, ``cordis:`` → loader
   builtin), import it, and run the *resolved cordis's own*
   ``resolveConfig({Config}, config)`` — the exact call that produces the
   boot-time rejection. A throw IS the finding;
5. recurse into ``group`` rows through their ``config`` list.

No schema is copied or re-declared here. The oracle is whatever ``Config``
schema the resolved package exports, so the guard cannot drift from the plugin
set it validates against — that drift is precisely the defect class it exists
to catch. Known and deliberate divergences from upstream's *reader* helpers
(never from the loader): the group test is truthiness, matching the loader,
where ``dsh-agent-presets`` ``flattenRows`` uses ``=== true``; and a row whose
module cannot be resolved is a finding here, as dsh's own roster health check
also reports it.

Isolation and access boundaries (M7.7 (a) precedent, FEAT-015/016)
------------------------------------------------------------------
* The guard is **read-only static analysis over repo files plus module imports
  from the resolved plugin plane**. It performs one narrow READ of
  ``$DSH_HOME/profiles`` (and, when ``DSH_HOME`` is set, only then — it never
  guesses ``~/.dsh``) to resolve the plugin set dsh would load. It writes
  nothing to ``$DSH_HOME``, and the probe subprocess runs with ``DSH_HOME``
  redirected to a freshly created empty temp directory which is deleted
  afterwards.
* The isolated-home **witness is exactly that**: an entry count of the temp
  directory this run created (empty by construction), reported as
  ``home_writes``. It proves zero writes to that isolated home. It is NOT a
  global no-write proof — it cannot observe a write made anywhere else (a
  plugin's own ``os.homedir()`` write would land outside it), and
  ``USERPROFILE``/``HOME`` are not redirected.
* Module import executes only each package's own top-level evaluation — the
  same code ``dsh`` evaluates when it mounts the row. ``apply`` is never
  called, no ``Context``/``Fiber`` is constructed, and no plugin lifecycle
  runs.

Verdicts (repo optional-tooling policy)
---------------------------------------
``PASS``   at least one enabled row was validated against the resolved
           schemas, **and** every enabled row that could not be validated is
           disclosed (the ``coverage`` block, plus one ``[NOT_RUN]`` line per
           unverified row).
``FAIL``   a row's config was rejected (row id + module + the schema's exact
           message), a row's module could not be resolved, a ``!!js``
           expression threw, or a composition is not a valid entry list.
``NOT_RUN`` no node and/or no resolvable plugin set (with the reason), nothing
           could be verified, **or enabled rows exist but not one of them was
           compared against a schema** (``rows_checked == 0`` — e.g. every
           enabled row's module exports no ``Config``). ``NOT_RUN`` never counts
           as a gate issue — it discloses an unverified fact instead of
           inventing a green one. The second clause is the invariant behind
           ``coverage``: zero validated rows can never render as ``PASS``.

#: §4.3 L3).
#:
#: The PASS branch of the render layer decides what to put on screen from this
#: set instead of from a substring of a message ("NOT verified"): that string
#: coupling is why five ``NO_SCHEMA`` rows could be unverified and invisible at
#: the same time (AUDIT-153 G-01④).
#:
#: * ``NO_SCHEMA`` — the module exports no ``Config``, so nothing to validate
#:   the row's config against. The message asserts nothing about what the
#:   loader then does with it (that behaviour is a separate, unverified fact).
#: * ``BUILTIN`` — a ``cordis:`` loader builtin: no module to import, hence no
#:   schema to apply. This covers a **leaf** builtin row. The ``BUILTIN`` record
#:   of a **group** row is the same kind for the same reason, but it is tagged
#:   ``builtin: "group"`` and is routed to ``[INFO]`` by :func:`_classify_row`
#:   instead: a group is structure, it carries a child count rather than a config,
#:   and there is no config whose verification could be missing (G-02).
#: * ``DISABLED_INHERITED_UNKNOWN`` — a child whose ancestor group carries a
#:   `disabled` expression that THREW. The loader's ancestor walk
#:   (`Entry._disabled`'s `while (entry) { if (this.disabledOf(entry.options))
#:   return true; … }`) evaluates that expression unguarded, so the mount is
#:   rejected — a real finding (G03-b) — and at the same time not one of this
#:   group's children can be known to start. They are counted here, not as
#:   inherited-disabled: "we know it never starts" and "we could not find out"
#:   are different facts and must not share a counter.
#:
#: ``DISABLED_INHERITED`` is deliberately **absent**: such a row never starts
#: (its ancestor is disabled), so the probe does not count it in
#: ``entry.enabled`` either (`inherited_disabled` is its own counter, read from
#: `Entry._disabled`'s ancestor walk). Counting it here would put a row into
#: the trust surface that is not part of the enabled denominator, and the PASS
#: sentence would then contradict itself ("verified 1 of 1 … 1 enabled row(s)
#: NOT verified", F-01). Not started is not "we failed to check it" — and it

# Design §2.5 C-3: every host literal this guard used to inline — the install
# scope / cli package / anchor, the two environment overrides, the profiles
# directory name, the `DSH_HOME` variable it reads, the composition file name and
# its globs, and the oracle packages with the symbols this guard calls them
# through — is declared in `adapters/dsh/host-contract.json`.
#
# The declared symbols are read from the contract at import (see
# `_declared`/the binding block below), so this module holds no copy of a host
# value. A contract that is missing, unreadable, malformed or of an unknown
# schema makes that read raise and the module fail to import its facts;
# `check_dsh_preset_compat()` maps the same failure to `NOT_RUN` (unreadable) or
# `FAIL` (malformed) per §2.5.1 instead of validating against an inlined copy.
#
# `PROBE_SCRIPT` likewise carries no package name and no symbol name of its own:
# both are injected into the probe request (see `_probe_request`).
#
# The oracle packages are the ones whose OWN code decides a row's fate, imported
# from the resolved plane, never re-implemented:
#   * `cordis-plugin-include` — the `!!js` YAML dialect (its entry-list schema)
#   * `cordis-plugin-loader`  — the `!!js` evaluate / isJsExpr pair
#   * `cordis`                — `resolveConfig`, the call that throws
#   * `js-yaml`               — the parser those schemas are loaded with
# Their versions are reported next to every verdict, because "which plugin set
# did this validate against" is part of the answer.
#
# A preset directory is a directory holding the declared composition file
# (`COMPOSITION_FILE` in the presets package); the shipped render source — the
# token template the two renderers substitute — must satisfy the same row
# contract as a mounted preset. FIX-310: the template now lives with the preset
# payload it renders; the composition globs are depth-agnostic.
#
# The declared symbols below are the *source* names of the facts; their values
# are read from the contract lazily (see `__getattr__` after `_declared`), so a
