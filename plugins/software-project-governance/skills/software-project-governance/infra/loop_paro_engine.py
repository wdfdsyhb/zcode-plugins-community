"""Persistent Plan-Act-Observe-Reflect (PARO) state machine + CAS writer.

FEAT-005 (ADR-014 §3, 0.68.0). Product code, authorized by Design Review
APPROVED_WITH_NOTES/0 (EVD-841).

This module is the **executable PARO state machine**: it constrains
``loop_state.agent_phase`` transitions to the legal set defined in ADR-014 §3.2,
and persists every transition to ``flow-unit-runtime.json`` under a per-unit
monotonic **CAS version** (``loop_state.cas_version``, the additive field
introduced by FEAT-005) using optimistic concurrency control.

**Scope (FEAT-005 ONLY):**

  - The pure transition validator (:func:`validate_transition`) — the §3.2 table
    encoded as an executable predicate.
  - The CAS-guarded transition writer (:func:`apply_transition`) — read →
    validate → compute → atomic write with conflict detection.
  - Activation (:func:`activate_unit`) — the ``(entry) → plan`` transition that
    assigns the initial ``cas_version = 0``.
  - Restart recovery (:func:`recover_state`) — read-based (not replay-based);
    the event-log consistency hook is present but a no-op when the log is
    ``None`` (FEAT-007 provides the log).

**Out of scope (NOT implemented here):**

  - FEAT-006 (gate processor / fuse production wiring). This module exposes the
    state machine the gate processor will drive; it does not itself consume
    production gate events.
  - FEAT-007 (event log JSONL). The ``event_log`` parameters are hooks: when
    ``None`` (the only value FEAT-005 passes), the consistency/replay checks are
    skipped per §3.5 ("state file alone is sufficient").

**Constraints honored:**

  - The 0.67.0 v2 validator (``checks.flow_unit_runtime_v2
    .validate_flow_unit_runtime_payload_v2``) is byte-frozen; this module does
    NOT modify it. The additive transition/CAS validation pass lives in a
    SEPARATE function (``validate_loop_runtime_v2_with_transitions``) added to
    that module.
  - ``loop_engine.py``'s pure functions (``derive_round`` / ``fuse_decision`` /
    ``escalation_payload`` / ``activate_loop_state``) are NOT modified. This
    module's fuse boundary deliberately matches ``fuse_decision`` exactly
    (``escalate if loop_count > max_rounds else iterate``) so the two never
    diverge.
  - The contract ``schema_version`` stays ``"2.0"``; ``cas_version`` is a
    per-unit additive field.
  - RISK-037 / RISK-042 remain open.

**CAS protocol (ADR-014 §3.3), implemented in :func:`apply_transition`:**

    1. READ    unit = load runtime_file → flow_units[id]
                expected_version = unit.loop_state.cas_version
                from_phase       = unit.loop_state.agent_phase
    2. VALIDATE transition (from_phase, to_phase, event) is legal; else FAIL
    3. COMPUTE new_unit = apply §3.2 side effects
                new_unit.loop_state.cas_version = expected_version + 1
    4. WRITE   (atomic, lock-guarded critical section):
                re-read on-disk; if on-disk cas_version != expected_version
                  → CONFLICT (another writer advanced this unit; no write)
                else: temp-file + os.replace (atomic rename)
    5. RETURN  TransitionResult(success/conflict/illegal, new cas_version)

The per-file ``threading.Lock`` guards ONLY the re-read-check-replace critical
section (step 4), NEVER the compute (step 3) — this is the §3.3 "optimistic
locking without holding a lock across the compute step" discipline, and it is
what makes the threading test deterministic: N writers that all read version V
produce exactly one commit at V+1 and N-1 CONFLICT results (no lost updates).

    from loop_paro_engine import (
        validate_transition, apply_transition, activate_unit, recover_state,
        TransitionResult, RecoveryResult,
    )

    # Pure legality check (no I/O):

        boundary).

    """Apply a CAS-guarded PARO phase transition for ``unit_id``.

    Implements the §3.3 CAS protocol: READ → VALIDATE → COMPUTE → atomic WRITE
    with conflict detection. On success the unit's ``loop_state.cas_version``
    is incremented by exactly 1 and the file is replaced atomically (a reader
    never sees a torn state). On conflict (another writer committed a transition
    for this unit between our read and our write) the writer returns
    ``STATUS_CONFLICT`` and writes nothing — fail-closed, no lost updates.

    The ``side_effects`` callable, if supplied, is invoked as
    ``side_effects(new_unit, event)`` AFTER the canonical §3.2 side effects are
    applied and BEFORE the cas_version bump; it may augment the new unit (e.g.
    FEAT-006 adding evidence_refs / pause points) and must return the (possibly
    mutated) unit dict. It is the extension hook for the gate processor.

    **FEAT-007 event-log hook (additive, ADR-014 §5.2 point 3):** when
    ``event_log`` is provided, a transition event is appended to the event log
    AFTER the atomic state write commits — state-first/event-second ordering.
    A crash between the two leaves a committed state with a missing event;
    :func:`recover_state` detects this (on-disk version > last logged) and
    synthesizes a ``phase_recovery`` event (§3.5). When ``event_log`` is None
    (the FEAT-005 default — the event log is FEAT-007), no event is appended;
    the existing behavior is byte-identical. The append is best-effort: a lost
    event is recoverable; it does NOT roll back the committed state.

    Args:
        unit_id: The flow_unit_id to transition.
        to_phase: The target phase (``plan|act|observe|reflect|exit|escalate|
            withdrawn``). Activation ((entry)→plan) uses :func:`activate_unit`.
        event: The transition event dict (passed to :func:`validate_transition`
            and to ``side_effects``).
        runtime_file: Path to ``flow-unit-runtime.json``.
        side_effects: Optional ``(new_unit, event) -> new_unit`` callable.
        max_retries: On CONFLICT, retry the whole read-validate-compute-write
            cycle this many times (re-reading fresh state each time) before
            returning STATUS_CONFLICT. Default 0 = fail-closed on the first
            conflict. Retries re-validate against the fresh on-disk version, so
            a retried transition commits at a higher cas_version only if it is
            still legal from the new state.
        event_log: FEAT-007 hook. Accepts:
            - None (skip append — FEAT-005 default, byte-identical behavior);
            - True (append to the default log path under the runtime file's
              host root, i.e. ``<runtime_file parent>/.governance/
              loop-event-log.jsonl``);
            - a path (str/Path) to a JSONL event log file;
            - a callable ``(event_dict) -> None`` (custom sink, used by tests).
            The appended event is the §5.1 envelope (event_id, timestamp,
            unit_id, event_type, cas_version, from_version, from_phase,
            to_phase, actor, payload).
        event_log_path: DEPRECATED alias for passing a path via ``event_log``;
            kept for call-site readability. When both are given, ``event_log``
            wins.
        actor: the actor string recorded on the appended event (default
            ``"loop_paro_engine"``).

    Returns:
        TransitionResult. Never raises on transition/CAS outcomes — unexpected
        I/O errors surface as ``STATUS_ERROR`` with the exception message.

    active``, ``fuse.max_rounds = fuse_max_rounds``, and assigns the INITIAL

    state (no cas_version / dormant): if another writer already activated this
    unit (cas_version present on disk), the writer returns STATUS_CONFLICT and
    does not double-activate.

        max_retries: CAS retry budget on conflict (default 0).
        event_log: FEAT-007 hook (see :func:`apply_transition`). When provided,
            a ``phase_enter`` event is appended AFTER the activation commits.
            None (default) → no append (byte-identical to FEAT-005).
        event_log_path: DEPRECATED alias (see :func:`apply_transition`).
        actor: the actor string recorded on the appended event (default
            ``"loop_paro_engine"``).

    Returns:

    Restart recovery is **read-based, not replay-based**: the current-state file
    IS the recovered state. For each ``active`` unit, ``agent_phase``,
    ``loop_count``, ``fuse``, and ``cas_version`` are read directly. No event
    replay is performed.

    When ``event_log`` is supplied (the FEAT-007 hook), consistency is verified:

      - **On-disk ahead of log** (a state write committed but the event append
        was lost — the defensive case): the state file is trusted and a
        synthetic ``phase_recovery`` event is recorded in
        :attr:`RecoveryResult.synthetic_events` for FEAT-007 to append.
      - **Log ahead of on-disk** (a state write was lost — the DANGEROUS case):
        the unit is fail-closed to ``runtime_status = blocked`` with a
        ``recovery_conflict`` classification. The engine does NOT silently
        replay, because replaying a transition whose side effects (e.g. an
        external action) may have partially occurred is unsafe.

    When ``event_log`` is None (the only value FEAT-005 passes — the event log
    is FEAT-007), the consistency check is SKIPPED per §3.5 ("state file alone
    is sufficient"). FEAT-005's recovery is complete without the log.

    Args:
        runtime_file: Path to ``flow-unit-runtime.json``.
