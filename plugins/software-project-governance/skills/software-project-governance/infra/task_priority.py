"""Task dependency / priority analysis — FIX-226 (0.71.0).

This module is the **pure dependency-analysis layer** for the governance
plan-tracker. It parses the ``优先级一览`` priority tables in
``plan-tracker.md`` — including the headerless ``### 最近完成（本会话提交窗口）``
window table (FIX-251) — builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the ``依赖``
(dependency) column, and computes which tasks are blocked / unblocked / ready
to recommend as the next step.

It exists to close the AUDIT-141 / FIX-223 gap: the ``依赖`` column was
free-text with no machine-parseable graph and no "what's unblocked" computation,
so the behavior protocol could not honor its own rule (analyze dependencies
before recommending next steps). This tool provides that analysis.

**Third-class status filter (FIX-237.2 / ADR-017 §4.4 P1-3):** dependency
satisfaction alone does NOT make a row an executable candidate. Only rows whose
status leading marker is ⏳ (pending/active) — or which have no leading status
marker at all — may enter ``Unblocked`` / ``Recommended next``. Rows with a
terminal / non-executable leading marker (⛔ blocked, ⏸ split/held, 🔴 blocked,
🚧 historical in-progress, 🛑 stopped, 📋 queued, ✅ completed) are excluded
even when dependency-satisfied and reported in a separate ``non_executable``
bucket. FIX-288 ⑦ extends the filter beyond leading markers: non-✅ terminal
WORDING (completion-word forms like the live 「🔄 规划段完成 + M-0 裁决完成」,
bare 已终止/已撤回/... prefixes) is non-executable too — 「🔄 进行中」 stays
active (🔄 also marks genuine in-progress rows).

**Cycle tolerance (FIX-237.2):** a dependency cycle is a WARNING, not an ERROR.
The report keeps the cycle list for visibility, sets the ``cycle_warning``
flag, formats a ``CYCLE DETECTED (WARNING)`` banner, and still produces the
best-effort analysis.

**Empty-recommendation fallback (FIX-254 / REQ-110):** when no task is
unblocked (``recommended_next == []`` — the live-data norm: total > 0 with
unblocked = 0), the report never degrades to a bare empty list (the
AUDIT-143 data-layer root cause of the "mechanically enumerate an
unfinished item" degradation). :func:`compute_unblocked_tasks` walks the
blocked dependency graph and attaches either (a) an
:class:`UnblockRecommendation` — the head node of the highest-value blocked
chain (the root blocker whose resolution reopens the most downstream
tasks), with a dependency reason — and/or (b) a structured
``empty_reason`` (``all_blocked`` / ``all_non_executable`` /
``no_active_tasks``) with the nearest actionable step.
:func:`format_report` renders both; downstream consumers
(loop_exit_bridge.py / the next-candidates CLI) forward them as machine
fields.

**Purity contract (load-bearing):** this module imports ONLY the Python
standard library. The compute functions (:func:`parse_task_dependencies`,
:func:`compute_unblocked_tasks`, :func:`format_report`) perform NO file I/O and
hold NO module-level mutable state. The CLI entry in ``verify_workflow.py``
passes the file *text* to :func:`parse_task_dependencies`, keeping the
analysis trivially testable with fixture strings and deterministic across
runs. Documented I/O exceptions (FEAT-012 G5 consolidation): besides the
``_coerce_text`` convenience read, the RECO snapshot writer
(:func:`write_recommendation_snapshot`), the tpa last-run cache helpers
(:func:`read_last_run_state` / :func:`write_last_run_state`), the FIX-341
archive-index resolution helpers (:func:`parse_archive_index_completed_ids`
takes TEXT — pure; :func:`read_archive_index_completed_ids` /
:func:`_archive_index_mtime` read the parameterized index path) and the CLI
orchestrator :func:`run_cli_analysis` perform explicit, parameterized file
I/O — they never touch module state and stay stdlib-only at module level.
FEAT-077 / ADR-021 §2.2.2 (3) adds one more documented orchestration-layer
exception: :func:`_resolve_row_demand_sources` lazily imports
``change_triage.load_triage_records`` (function-local — a module-level
import would be circular since change_triage imports THIS module) to feed
the PURE :func:`resolve_demand_source` authority merge; the compute path
itself stays stdlib-only with no peer coupling.

**Task-family vs cross-entity (FIX-171 precedent):** the ``依赖`` column
routinely mixes task-family IDs (``FIX-162``, ``REL-047``, ``AUDIT-124`` —
things that can appear as Task IDs and therefore have a status) with
cross-entity reference IDs (``RISK-039``, ``DEC-090``, ``REVIEW-FIX-155`` —
descriptive context that is NEVER a task and has no status). Only task-family
dependencies can block a task; a cross-entity ref is descriptive and never
blocks. This mirrors the AUDIT-126 / FIX-171 fix in ``archive.py``.

Usage::

    from task_priority import parse_task_dependencies, compute_unblocked_tasks, format_report
    text = Path(".governance/plan-tracker.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    tasks = parse_task_dependencies(text)
    report = compute_unblocked_tasks(tasks)

# (no false block). The list below was derived from the real governance data
# (prefixes that appear as Task IDs in plan-tracker table rows). ``FEAT`` and

    Approximation note (declared semantics, FIX-258 / R0 F-3): a multi-node

# index (``.governance/archive/index.md`` 「## Task 索引」 table). Resolution
# order per dependency:
#
#   1. hot-table row (authoritative — ⏳/🔴/… still blocks even if a stale
#      archive row claims completion);

#   3. neither → blocking (fail-closed, FIX-171 conservative default kept).

# Purity: :func:`parse_archive_index_completed_ids` takes the index TEXT
# (pure); :func:`read_archive_index_completed_ids` is the documented I/O
# exception (parameterized path, like :func:`_coerce_text` / the snapshot

def parse_task_dependencies(plan_tracker_text_or_path) -> list:
    """Parse plan-tracker markdown text into a list of :class:`TaskDep`.

    Accepts either the raw markdown **text** (str/bytes) or a path-like. When
    given a path, the text is read as UTF-8 (this is the ONLY file I/O in the
    module and it exists purely as a convenience for the common case; the CLI
    entry in verify_workflow.py passes text directly so the compute path stays
    I/O-free and trivially testable).

    **str path/text disambiguation (FIX-252 O1):** a ``str`` is ambiguous — it
    may be document text OR a str-form path. If the str *looks like a path*
    (names an existing file, has a drive prefix, or ends in ``.md``/``.txt``
    with a path separator — see :func:`_looks_like_str_path`) it is read from
    disk; a path-like str naming a non-existent file raises
    :class:`ValueError` (never a silent ``total 0``). Ordinary markdown text
    stays on the text channel.

    Scans every priority task table in the document — both the header-driven
    ``| 优先级 | ID | ... |`` tables (``### 优先级一览`` and ``### 已归档版本
    task``) and the headerless window table directly under ``### 最近完成
    （本会话提交窗口）`` (a 7-col task table with NO header row; FIX-251).
    Duplicate task IDs across tables are de-duplicated keeping the
    FIRST occurrence (the ``优先级一览`` table is authoritative for active
    tasks; the archived-version pointer table repeats FIX-082..087 only as a
    hot-fact-source proof and would otherwise shadow the active entry — though
    in practice the IDs do not collide across the two tables).

    Robustness:
      - Header-driven column indexing: the ID/依赖/目标版本/状态 columns are
        located by matching the header cell text (``ID`` / ``依赖`` /
        ``目标版本`` / ``状态``), not by hardcoded indices. This survives both
        the 7-col priority table and the archived-pointer variant.
      - Fallback ID detection: if header indexing fails, the ID cell is the
        first data cell matching ``^[A-Z]+-\\d+$`` (handles the malformed
        leading-``**P0**`` rows at live lines 174-176).
      - Headerless window table (FIX-251): a ``|`` row that DIRECTLY follows
        a heading and carries both a bare task ID cell and a status cell
        enters a headerless task table whose column layout is inferred from
        the canonical 7-col shape. Prose between the heading and the table
        disarms this, so non-task tables (``需求跟踪矩阵`` etc.) are never
        misread.
      - Separator rows and non-table lines are skipped.

    Args:
        plan_tracker_text_or_path: markdown text (str/bytes) or a path to the
            plan-tracker.md file. A path may be a Path-like object or a
            str-form path (auto-detected by :func:`_looks_like_str_path`).

    Returns:
        List of :class:`TaskDep` in document order (de-duplicated by task_id).

    path (``parse_task_dependencies('D:\\\\...\\\\plan-tracker.md')``) got a

    (the pre-fix bug). Now a str that *looks like a path*

    **Robustness strategy — ID-anchored parsing.** The live plan-tracker has
    two kinds of malformed rows that break naive header-index parsing:

      1. Rows whose 闭环路径 (closure-path) cell contains unescaped ``|``
         (e.g. ``| RISK-`` 行 inside FIX-176's prose). These over-split: a
         7-column row yields 8+ cells, so a fixed ``cells[6]`` status index
         lands inside the prose.
      2. Rows with a duplicated leading priority cell (``| **P0** | **P0** |
         FIX-222 | ... |`` — live lines 174-176). These shift every header
         index by +1 and add a trailing empty cell.

    Both are handled by anchoring on the **ID cell** (the first cell matching

    reading the status from the LAST non-empty cell — which is invariant to

      - priority: cell at ``k-1`` (the cell immediately before the ID; this is
        the ``**P0**`` cell in both the normal and duplicated-priority layouts)

            authoritative (a hot ⏳/🔴 row still blocks even when the set
            contains its ID); an ID in neither layer still blocks (FIX-171
            conservative default kept). Omitting the parameter (or passing
            an empty set) reproduces the pre-FIX-341 behavior exactly.

    Algorithm:
      1. Build a status lookup: ``{task_id: is_completed}``.
      2. Build the dependency graph: ``{task_id: task_family_dependencies}``.
      3. Detect cycles (DFS). Cycles are reported on the result but do NOT
         infinite-loop; the rest of the analysis proceeds normally.
      4. Classify each task:
           - ``completed`` — status ✅.
           - ``blocked`` — not completed AND has ≥1 task-family dependency
             that is not provably completed (either the dep is in the table
             with non-✅ status, or the dep is missing from the table AND
             not proven completed by ``archive_completed_ids`` — fail-closed:
             an unknown task-family ID cannot be proven done).
           - ``non_executable`` — not completed, all task-family dependencies
             are completed (or none), but the status leading marker is
             terminal / non-executable (⛔/⏸/🔴/🚧/🛑/📋/✅) — the third-class
             status filter (FIX-237.2 / ADR-017 §4.4 P1-3) — or the cell
             carries non-✅ terminal wording (FIX-288 ⑦). Reported separately
             so filtered rows stay visible.
           - ``unblocked`` — not completed, all task-family dependencies are
             completed (or it has none), AND the status leading marker is ⏳
             or absent (status candidate-eligible).
      5. ``recommended_next`` = ``unblocked`` sorted by priority then version.
      6. ``cycle_warning`` = whether any cycle was detected (WARN, not ERROR).
      7. **Empty-recommendation fallback (REQ-110 / FIX-254):** when
         ``recommended_next`` is empty (the live-data norm: total>0 with
         unblocked=0), analyze the blocked dependency graph and attach
         ``unblock_recommendation`` (head of the highest-value blocked chain
         + dependency reason) and/or a structured ``empty_reason``
         (all_blocked / all_non_executable / no_active_tasks + nearest
         actionable step). A bare empty recommendation is forbidden — it is
         the AUDIT-143 data-layer root cause of the机械枚举 degradation.
         The blocker walk behind the fallback is bounded by a per-walk
         visit budget (FIX-258 / R0 F-2); on exhaustion the recommendation
         reason notes that downstream attribution may be truncated.

    Cross-entity refs (RISK/DEC/REVIEW/...) are never dependencies in the
    graph and never block (FIX-171 precedent).
