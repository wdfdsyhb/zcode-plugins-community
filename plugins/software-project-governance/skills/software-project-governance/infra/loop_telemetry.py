"""Production telemetry — honest flow/DORA metrics from the loop event log.

FEAT-008 (ADR-015, 0.69.0). Product code, authorized by Design Review
APPROVED_WITH_NOTES/0.

This module is the **honest telemetry layer** for the Loop Engine: it computes
flow metrics (cycle time, lead time, iteration-count distribution, back-edge
frequency) and DORA-style metrics (deployment/unit-completion frequency, lead
time for changes, change failure rate, time to restore/escalate) **purely from
the 0.68.0 event log** (``loop-event-log.jsonl`` as read by
:func:`loop_event_log.read_events`).

The single load-bearing property (AUDIT-133 / EVD-707): **every metric is
either a real number measured from defined events, or ``unknown`` with a reason
— never a proxy, never a fabricated zero.** Concretely:

  - Zero completed units → ``status="unknown"`` (NOT ``0``).
  - Unresolved fuse trips → reported as an ``open_fuse_trips`` count (NOT
    imputed as MTTR=0).
  - Deployment frequency counts ``loop_exit`` (unit completion), NOT release
    passes — and is labeled "unit-completion frequency" so it is not mistaken
    for whole-project release cadence.
  - Change failure rate's denominator is **completed units**, NOT total loops
    (the ``fuse_trips/total_loops`` proxy is the exact substitution
    ``loop_health._compute_dora_metrics`` performs and this module replaces).

**Purity (load-bearing, ADR-015 §6.2):** :func:`compute_metrics` is a pure
function — no file I/O, no ``datetime.now()``, no module-level mutable state.
The only time reference is the events' own timestamps; windowing is relative to
the *latest event timestamp* in the input, so a fixed event fixture always
yields the same report regardless of when the test runs. The CLI wrapper
(``cmd_loop_telemetry`` in verify_workflow.py) is the only place that reads the
file; this module is input→output.

Scope (no overclaim): the metrics describe the loop unit lifecycle only (a
unit's path from phase_enter to loop_exit or unit_withdrawn). They are not a
whole-software-project DORA report and do not claim the loop engine is
production-ready. RISK-037/RISK-042 remain open (external validation is
VAL-008/009).

**FEAT-044 (0.88.0 slice E3) — round-stall (waiting-tax) observability:**
:func:`compute_stall_report` is the telemetry counterpart of the FEAT-044
engine mechanisms (``loop_engine.resolve_round_budget`` /
``heartbeat_should_fire`` / ``interrupt_recovery_payload``). It measures, per
unit, how many CLOSED rounds (anchor intervals — the same anchoring as the
cycle-time metric) contain no artifact-type event (default: ``gate_result``,
the only non-terminal substantive outcome type in the closed event enum) and
reports the trailing/max idle streaks plus the ``suspects`` whose trailing
streak reached the heartbeat threshold. Empirical grounding: FIX-357 (~15-round
Dev stall) / FIX-359 (16 rounds) — EVD-1101① "round delay tax". Honesty
boundary (FEAT-063 alignment): idle streaks are ATTENTION signals for
heartbeat reporting — NOT stop proofs; a silent stall (no new anchors at all)
is visible only as ``last_anchor_ts`` staleness, which needs the caller's
wall clock to judge (purity forbids this module from using one). Same purity
contract as :func:`compute_metrics` (no I/O, no ``datetime.now()``, no module
state).

This module imports only stdlib at module top level. It depends on
``loop_event_log`` solely for the *event shape* (it never calls its functions in
the pure path). It does NOT import ``loop_paro_engine`` /
``loop_gate_processor`` (ADR-015 §6.4) — telemetry is a *consumer* of the event
log, not a peer of the engine.

Usage::

    from loop_event_log import read_events
    from loop_telemetry import compute_metrics
    events = read_events(log_path=path)
    report = compute_metrics(events, window="30d")
    for name, mv in report.dora.items():
        print(name, mv.status, mv.value, mv.reason)

    # FEAT-044 (0.88.0 E3): waiting-tax view for heartbeat reporting.
    from loop_telemetry import compute_stall_report
    stalls = compute_stall_report(events, idle_threshold=3)
    for uid in stalls.suspects:
        print(uid, stalls.units[uid]["idle_streak_trailing"])
