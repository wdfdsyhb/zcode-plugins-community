"""Read-only bootstrap aggregate — FEAT-033 (AUDIT-154 slice A-2, v0.84.0).

One command that answers "where am I and what is next" in a single output,
replacing the bootstrap protocol's multi-file reads + repeated verify calls
(AUDIT-154 measured 31 tool calls / 19 serial round-trips per session turn;
arch consultant P0: aggregating into one command is the precondition for
19 -> 2-4 serial steps).

Aggregated faces (single output, ≤2K token / ≤8KB projection):

* ``resolve``   — the resolve_entry envelope subset (dual-root authority,
                  DEC-096 / DEC-080; reused via import, never re-derived).
* ``migration`` — version-comparison FLAG only (active_version vs the
                  plan-tracker record). Never executes a migration.
* ``project`` / ``gates`` / ``tasks`` / ``risks`` / ``recent`` — a LEAN
                  status projection parsed line-wise from the hot governance
                  files. The regexes/table shapes deliberately MIRROR the
                  proven engine calibers (``parse_project_config`` /
                  ``parse_gate_status`` / ``parse_active_risks`` /
                  ``parse_recent_decisions`` and resolve_entry's plan-tracker
                  version regex) the same way resolve_entry mirrors the
                  engine — disclosed here so the two readers stay in sync by
                  review, not by import (see the R2 note below). Since
                  FIX-397④ the risks face carries ONE declared caliber
                  divergence from ``parse_active_risks`` — its ``open`` count
                  is the risk-log's NON-CLOSED rows (see
                  ``parse_risk_summary``). R0 P0-1
                  lesson (0.84.0 R1): review-only sync demonstrably failed on
                  live-shaped files, so the table scanner now mirrors the
                  engine's ``_status_table_stream`` LINE FOR LINE
                  (separator-validated headers; blank lines tolerated INSIDE
                  a table, never terminators) and a bidirectional
                  differential test against the engine stream guards the
                  mirror (``SegmentedTableMirrorTests``).
* ``candidates``— the task-priority-analysis LIGHT path reused verbatim via
                  ``import task_priority`` (pure-stdlib peer leaf:
                  parse_task_dependencies + compute_unblocked_tasks). Empty
                  recommendations carry the structured ``empty_reason`` /
                  ``unblock_recommendation`` (REQ-110 / FIX-254) — never a
                  bare empty list.
* ``health``    — v1 contract: ``state="deferred"`` + ``pending_checks`` +
                  a ``check-governance`` next_action. NO health check has
                  run — this command never pretends it did (QR-4 禁「没查」
                  报「通过」).
* ``behavior``  — the FEAT-040 gray-release face (via ``behavior_profile``)
                  plus the FEAT-082 ``session_closure`` sub-face: the
                  ADR-021 §3.2.3 closure-rate metric in Check 42's exact
                  judgment caliber (imported pure domain functions); since
                  FEAT-083 the event collection rides the SAME shared
                  collector leaf the engine's Check 42 consumes
                  (``checks.provenance_domain`` — the disclosed engine
                  mirror is retired). A METRIC PROJECTION — health checks
                  remain deferred.
* ``next_actions`` / ``deferred`` — derived guidance and the fail-safe
                  budget disclosure.

Budget + honesty contract:

* ``--budget-ms`` (default 3000): a monotonic wall-clock deadline checked
  between build phases. On exhaustion the command returns everything
  finished so far plus a ``deferred`` list naming each section that did not
  run (``reason: "budget_exhausted"``) — fail-safe, never a guessed pass.
* Read-only and idempotent: zero ``.governance`` writes, zero git writes,
  zero subprocess dispatch, no archive/migration invocation. Two runs over
  an unchanged tree produce identical payloads modulo the declared
  volatile fields (``generated_at`` / ``duration_ms``).

Boundary (same discipline as governance_cost.py / archguard_ratchet.py):
this module MUST NOT import ``verify_workflow`` (ArchGuard R2 — zero new
reverse edges; the engine only wires dispatch). Its own import face is
stdlib-only (ArchGuard R6 cold-import budget) plus the two engine-free
peer leaves ``resolve_entry`` and ``task_priority``.
