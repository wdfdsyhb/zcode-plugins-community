# ADR-009: Task ID Naming Convention

> **Status**: Proposed (pending DEC-100 adoption)
> **Date**: 2026-07-11
> **Addresses**: SYSGAP-045 (task ID prefix has no formal spec; FX/FIX number-space overlap)
> **Supersedes**: Implicit convention (none — FX prefix adopted without decision record)

## 1. Context

The project has accumulated 12+ task ID prefixes (FIX, FX, REL, AUDIT, REQ, VAL, DOC, MAINT, SYSGAP, TD, DEC, EVD, RISK) over 324+ tasks without a formal naming convention document. Key problems surfaced:

1. **No formal definition**: No governance document, ADR, or decision record defines prefix semantics. The FX prefix (first used FX-175, 2026-07-04) was adopted by Coordinator without a decision record. Full-repo grep for "FX 缩写"/"FX 代表"/"FX 全称" returns zero hits.

2. **Number-space collision**: plan-tracker simultaneously contains `FX-187` and `FIX-187` (two completely different tasks) — FX-187 is "release 0.64.1 patch", FIX-187 is "verify_workflow.py ROOT/SAMPLE_PATH crash fix". Same collision for FX-130/FIX-130, FX-131/FIX-131, FX-188/FIX-188. Referencing "187" is ambiguous.

3. **No validation**: `verify_workflow.py` validates format (`[A-Z]+-\d+`) but not prefix membership — `FOO-123` or `XYZ-999` would pass.

4. **FX/REL overlap**: Both FX-187 and REL-053 are "version-sliced release tasks" — same semantic, different prefixes.

## 2. Decision

### 2.1 Prefix taxonomy (authoritative)

| Prefix | Domain | Semantic | Example |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| **FIX** | Bug fix | Product code defect repair (root-cause fix, not feature) | FIX-170 (archive engine state filter) |
| **FEAT** | Feature | Version-sliced architecture/feature implementation slice with explicit release carrying (Slice N of M, Release Reviewer) | (replaces deprecated FX; future use) |
| **REL** | Release | Version publication task (CHANGELOG + version sync + release docs) | REL-053 (release 0.65.0) |
| **AUDIT** | Audit | Diagnostic/investigation task (read-only Analyst/Explore, produces finding) | AUDIT-130 (loop-engineering ADR) |
| **REQ** | Requirement | Requirement analysis / competitive research / needs definition | REQ-101 |
| **VAL** | Validation | External validation task (real-target verification run) | VAL-007 (shitu loop-engineering) |
| **DOC** | Documentation | Documentation completion (treatment-record category, Coordinator-direct) | DOC-001 |
| **MAINT** | Maintenance | Maintenance/cleanup/housekeeping | MAINT-001 |
| **SYSGAP** | System gap | Systemic governance gap identification (feeds improvement backlog) | SYSGAP-030 |
| **TD** | Tech debt | Tech-debt item (tracked, may not be versioned) | TD-014 |
| **COORD** | Coordinator | Coordinator internal task (reserved, currently unused) | — |
| ~~FX~~ | ~~Deprecated~~ | ~~Version-sliced implementation slice (FX-130~194, 2026-07-04~07-10)~~ | ~~Deprecated DEC-101: no defined abbreviation meaning; replaced by FEAT. Historical FX-130~194 tasks remain valid as committed, but no new FX tasks.~~ |

**FEAT vs FIX disambiguation rule**:
- **FIX** = reactive repair of an existing defect (something is broken)
- **FEAT** = proactive feature/architecture implementation slice (building something new, version-carried, multi-slice)

**FEAT vs REL disambiguation rule**:
- **FEAT** = implementation slice within a version (one of N slices, has Developer work + Code Reviewer)
- **REL** = the release publication itself (version bump + CHANGELOG + release docs + Release Reviewer)

**FX deprecation (DEC-101)**: FX prefix had no defined abbreviation meaning (full-repo grep for "FX 缩写"/"FX 代表"/"FX 全称" returned zero hits). FX-130~194 (12 tasks, 2026-07-04~07-10) remain valid as committed history; no new FX tasks. The "version-sliced implementation slice" role is now served by FEAT (feature, semantically clear).

### 2.2 Number-space uniqueness (mandatory)

**Rule**: Within a single prefix, numbers MUST be unique and sequential. Across prefixes, numbers MAY overlap (FX-187 and FIX-187 are syntactically distinct IDs).

**Rationale**: `[A-Z]+-\d+` already guarantees global uniqueness via the prefix. The number-space collision is only a *human-readability* concern, not a correctness concern.

**Mitigation for readability**: When referencing a task verbally or in prose, MUST include the full prefix (say "FIX-187" not "187").

### 2.3 Validation (verify_workflow.py enhancement — future)

**Current**: format-only regex `[A-Z]+-\d+`.
**Future (P3, not blocking)**: add a known-prefix whitelist check (advisory WARN, not FAIL) to catch typos like `FIXX-123`. This requires a product-code change and is deferred to a separate FIX/FX task.

### 2.4 Historical reconciliation (FIX-187 / FIX-188)

**Decision**: DO NOT renumber committed tasks (FIX-187, FIX-188). Rationale:
- `FIX-187` and `FIX-188` are already committed (407b74c, referenced in evidence-log EVD-686).
- Renumbering would break commit-message task-ID traceability, evidence-log cross-references, and Code Reviewer REVIEW-FIX-187-R0 / REVIEW-FIX-188 references.
- The collision is human-readability only, not correctness — both IDs are syntactically distinct.
- **Forward rule**: new FIX numbers MUST check FX number-space collision before assignment. If FX-{N} exists, FIX-{N} is discouraged (pick FIX-{N+1} or higher to avoid the same number). This rule is advisory (Coordinator judgment), not mechanically enforced.

## 3. No-overclaim boundary

- This convention governs task ID prefix selection for human clarity and future validation.
- It does NOT make any prefix "more correct" than another for a given task — the task's actual work and evidence determine correctness.
- It does NOT retroactively invalidate FX-175's adoption or any committed task.
- It does NOT claim the prefix list is exhaustive — new prefixes may be added via future ADR if a genuine new domain emerges.
