# 1.0.0 Readiness Gap Analysis - 0.48.0

Date: 2026-06-10
Task: AUDIT-113
Scope: post-0.47.0 audit before any 1.0.0 formal release.

This document reviews the current evidence after `v0.47.0` and turns the remaining 1.0.0 blockers into explicit pre-1.0.0 work. It does not claim 1.0.0 readiness.

No official approval. No marketplace approval. No universal/full runtime support. No external first-session pilot success. No Codex Desktop marketplace-management E2E PASS. No automatic best-tool selection. No universal plugin/skill/tool availability. No catalog entry runtime PASS. No 1.0.0 production-ready status.

## Source Facts

| Fact | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Latest published version is `v0.47.0`. | `git log -1 --oneline` returns `17fd24f REL-024: release 0.47.0`; `git tag --list "v1.0.0"` returns no tag. |
| 0.47.0 release is complete. | `.governance/evidence-log.md` records EVD-483/EVD-485 and REVIEW-REL-024; `docs/release/release-checklist-0.47.0.md` marks release checklist items PASS while keeping RISK-036 open. |
| RISK-036 remains open. | `.governance/risk-log.md` keeps RISK-036 status `打开` and requires official submission package, at least two external project validations, mainstream entry matrix, Desktop marketplace-management E2E PASS or conservative blocked carry-forward, capability selection trace, and clear delivery trust layer positioning. |
| Capability discovery/orchestration evidence exists. | 0.45.0 delivered capability context, registry, restricted-environment fixtures, and internal benchmark evidence; 0.46.0 consumed them in official submission positioning. |
| Mainstream loading guidance exists. | 0.47.0 delivered README and adapter loading guidance for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and opencode, with Tier 2 compatibility/research rows. |
| Codex Desktop marketplace-management lifecycle evidence is absent. | `docs/requirements/codex-desktop-marketplace-e2e-0.45.0.md` marks add/install/enable/invoke/upgrade/uninstall as BLOCKED / NOT_RUN. |
| Two external project validations are absent. | Repository search finds planning material and internal fixtures, but no evidence that two external projects completed the Agent Team workflow. |
| Early 1.0.0 requirement rows are stale. | Requirement matrix rows REQ-014, REQ-016, REQ-017, REQ-018, REQ-019, REQ-027, REQ-028, REQ-029, REQ-030, REQ-031, REQ-032, REQ-033, and REQ-058 still say downgraded/pending even though later releases absorbed many parts or reframed them. |

## Readiness Decision

1.0.0 is **not releasable** on 2026-06-10.

The current release state is healthy through 0.47.0, but the formal 1.0.0 claim would overstate the evidence unless the remaining blockers below are closed or explicitly converted into conservative release boundaries.

## Gap Matrix

| Gap | Status | Reason | Next item |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.47.0 release integrity | PASS | Release package, tag, remote CI, and no-overclaim release boundary are recorded. | Keep as 1.0.0 prerequisite evidence. |
| Official submission package | PARTIAL | 0.46.0 created submission and ecosystem positioning docs, but no official approval or marketplace submission result exists. | FIX-126 / 0.49.0: final submission bundle review and conservative publication boundary. |
| External project validation >= 2 | BLOCKED | No two external projects have validated the workflow end to end. Internal fixtures and CI are not substitutes. | VAL-001 / 0.49.0: run and record two external project validations or keep 1.0.0 blocked. |
| Codex Desktop marketplace-management E2E | BLOCKED | Real Desktop add/install/enable/invoke/upgrade/uninstall evidence is absent. | VAL-002 / 0.49.0: run Desktop lifecycle E2E if environment allows, or preserve blocked status in submission and release docs. |
| Mainstream entry matrix | PASS with boundaries | 0.47.0 provides Tier 1 and Tier 2 loading guidance and guard coverage. | Keep no-overclaim boundary. |
| Capability selection trace | PASS with boundaries | 0.45.0/0.46.0 prove diagnostic selection trace and registry use without automatic best-tool claims. | Keep no-overclaim boundary. |
| Legacy 1.0.0 requirement rows | RECONCILED_BY_FIX-124 | Several pre-0.35 rows still say pending or downgraded to 1.0.0 despite later architecture, guard, adapter, and docs work. | `docs/requirements/legacy-requirement-reconciliation-0.48.0.md` maps each row to ABSORBED, SUPERSEDED, STILL_BLOCKING, or NEEDS_FINAL_LEDGER. |
| Command E2E validation | LEDGER_CREATED_BY_FIX-125 | REQ-058 remains pending while later e2e and release gates exist; final 1.0.0 evidence still needs a clean full command matrix statement. | `docs/requirements/final-command-e2e-ledger-0.48.0.md` records the final command ledger and opens FIX-127 for the remaining governance-health release-gate failure. |
| RISK-036 closure | BLOCKED | Closure criteria are not fully satisfied because external validation and Desktop lifecycle evidence remain open. | REL-026 / 1.0.0 only after closure criteria are satisfied. |

## Planned Pre-1.0.0 Versions

| Version | Purpose | Required items |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.48.0 | 1.0.0 readiness reconciliation | AUDIT-113, FIX-124 legacy requirement matrix/dependency-chain reconciliation, FIX-125 final command E2E evidence ledger, FIX-127 governance-health release-gate repair, REL-025 release package. |
| 0.49.0 | external validation and official submission closure | VAL-001 external project validations, VAL-002 Desktop marketplace lifecycle or blocked carry-forward, FIX-126 final official submission bundle review, REL-026 release package. |
| 1.0.0 | formal release tag | No feature work; only after RISK-036 is closed or release criteria are updated with explicit conservative evidence and approval in governance records. |

## No-Overclaim Boundary

AUDIT-113 is a planning and evidence reconciliation item. It is not:

- an official submission;
- official approval or marketplace approval;
- a Desktop marketplace lifecycle PASS;
- external project validation;
- automatic best-tool selection;
- universal/full runtime support;
- a 1.0.0 production-ready release.
