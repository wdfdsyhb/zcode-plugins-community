# Official Readiness Gap Analysis - 0.56.0

> **ℹ️ Updated in 0.62.0 (FIX-167, DEC-093).** The zcode distribution note in
> Criterion 1 ("zcode has no public submission channel") reflected the 0.56.0
> reality. As of 0.62.0, zcode runtime ships a marketplace chain and this plugin
> installs via the shared Claude/zcode marketplace protocol
> (`/plugin marketplace add peterwangze/software-project-governance`). See
> [`zcode-marketplace-install.md`](./zcode-marketplace-install.md). The 0.56.0

Task: AUDIT-119

Version target: 0.56.0

Related risk: RISK-036

## Purpose

This is the 0.56.0 readiness baseline against the RISK-036 closure criteria. It supersedes the 0.41.0 gap analysis. It states honestly what is satisfied, what is still blocked, and what requires external action that cannot be closed inside this repository. It does not close RISK-036; it updates the gap baseline so the next planning cycle has an accurate picture.

## RISK-036 Closure Criteria (from risk-log)

The risk closes when ALL of the following are satisfied:

1. Official submission package complete.
2. At least 2 external projects validated with full PASS.
3. Mainstream entry matrix public and not overclaiming capability.
4. Codex Desktop plugin marketplace management real E2E PASS or explicitly blocked with conservative submission-package declaration.
5. Capability selection trace can explain available plugin/skill/tool/fallback in restricted environments without claiming automatic best-tool selection.
6. README/manifest/submission docs clearly express the delivery trust layer differentiation.

## Status Per Criterion (0.56.0)

| # | Criterion | Status | 0.56.0 evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Official submission package | PARTIAL | Claude Code submission package drafted (`docs/marketplace/claude-code-submission-0.56.0.md`); self-hosted marketplace works now (`/plugin marketplace add peterwangze/software-project-governance`). License fixed to MIT. **Gap**: actual Anthropic in-app submission is a user action, not done; zcode has no public submission channel (`docs/marketplace/zcode-local-load-0.56.0.md`). |
| 2 | ≥2 external projects full PASS | NOT_MET | VAL-003 (shitu) and VAL-004 (python_game) both returned FAIL/PARTIAL. installed-state full PASS not achieved. |
| 3 | Mainstream entry matrix public, no overclaim | PARTIAL | FIX-129 four-platform read E2E `pass=4, blocked=0, fail=0, total=4` (Claude/Codex/Gemini/opencode). zcode local load runtime-verified on one machine (EVD-610). **Gap**: zcode is local-only, not a public matrix entry; universal/full runtime support not claimed. |
| 4 | Codex Desktop lifecycle E2E PASS or blocked + conservative declaration | BLOCKED | Codex Desktop marketplace management remains BLOCKED / NOT_RUN for add/install/enable/invoke/upgrade/uninstall. Declared conservatively; no overclaim. |
| 5 | Capability selection trace in restricted environments, no automatic-best-tool claim | PARTIAL | 0.45.0 capability context trace PASS, external capability registry PASS, restricted host benchmark PASS. No automatic best-tool selection claimed. **Gap**: these are internal benchmarks, not external pilot success. |
| 6 | README/manifest/submission docs express delivery trust layer differentiation | PASS | DEC-072 positions the product as "AI coding delivery trust layer"; README carries it; manifests updated. |

## Summary

- **Satisfied (6)**: Criterion 6.
- **Partial (3)**: Criteria 1, 3, 5 — progress made, external action or validation still needed.
- **Not met (1)**: Criterion 2 — external projects not at full PASS.
- **Blocked (1)**: Criterion 4 — Codex Desktop lifecycle, declared conservatively.

RISK-036 is **not closeable** as of 0.56.0. The dominant blockers are external (external project validation full PASS, Codex Desktop lifecycle disposition, Anthropic submission outcome) and cannot be closed by repository work alone.

## What 0.56.0 Advanced

- zcode native plugin format shipped + local runtime verified (AUDIT-118, EVD-610).
- License changed UNLICENSED → MIT, unblocking official submission eligibility.
- Claude Code submission package and self-hosted marketplace path documented.
- zcode distribution limits documented honestly.

## What 0.56.0 Did Not Change

- No external project reached full PASS.
- No Codex Desktop marketplace-management E2E.
- No official/marketplace approval (Claude Code or zcode).
- RISK-036 and RISK-037 remain open.

## No-Overclaim Boundary

This analysis is an internal readiness baseline. No official approval. No marketplace approval. No two-real-project external validation full PASS. No Codex Desktop lifecycle PASS. No universal/full runtime support. No 1.0.0 production-ready claim.

RISK-036 remains open. RISK-037 remains open.
