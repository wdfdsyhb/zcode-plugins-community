## Behavior

## No-overclaim boundaries

No official approval. No marketplace approval. No universal/full runtime support. No external first-session pilot success. No external host-project validation. No RISK-036 closure. No RISK-037 closure. No RISK-039 closure (本体已修 but RISK-039 needs external host validation). No 1.0.0 readiness. Pure bug fix, no behavior change.
