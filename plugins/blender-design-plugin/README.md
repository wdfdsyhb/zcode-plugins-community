## Positioning

`blender-design` lets Codex drive a real Blender session through a guarded local Harness. Instead of returning a disposable image, it builds editable scene objects, materials, lights, cameras, animation, checkpoints, previews, and export receipts that you keep.

The Harness is a closed, structured-command surface: arbitrary Python is disabled by default, Blender data mutates only on the main thread, and every irreversible action needs an action-bound authorization token.

### Who it is for

- 3D artists and technical artists who want Codex to prepare scenes without losing editability.
- Pipeline engineers who need a scriptable, auditable Blender automation surface.
- Reviewers who need milestone previews and export receipts rather than a claim of success.

### What problem it solves

| Problem | What this plugin provides | Verifiable entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automation scripts break scenes | Main-thread-only mutation, scene revisions, request IDs | `scripts/harness/server.py`, `docs/Codex-Blender-Plugin-Architecture.md` |
| A failed step ruins the file | Milestone checkpoints and rollback evidence | `scripts/harness/snapshot.py` |
| Long exports block the session | Snapshot-isolated background jobs with explicit resume | `docs/verification/harness-runtime.md` |
| "It worked" cannot be verified | Media probes, hashes, reimport checks, receipts | `scripts/harness/exporter.py` |
| Missing assets stall a task | Ask-first policy, or labelled proxy design on explicit authorization | `docs/getting-started.zh-CN.md` |

## Capabilities and boundaries

### Supported

| Capability | Input | Output | Limit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scene assembly | Idea, references, or timeline | Collections, stable object identity, transforms, BMesh, curves, modifiers | Approved asset imports only | Stable |
| Modeling and surfacing | Design intent | Hard-surface and procedural recipes, UVs, PBR materials, Geometry Nodes, sculpt, Hair Curves, baking | — | Stable |
| Rigging and animation | Character or prop intent | Armatures, weights, IK/FK, constraints, Actions, F-Curves, NLA, shape keys, retargeting | — | Stable |
| Cinematography | Shot intent | Camera paths, handheld response, lighting, Eevee/Cycles, compositor graphs, passes, EXR delivery | — | Stable |
| Simulation and sequence | Scene intent | Rigid body, cloth, soft body, smoke, cache baking, Grease Pencil, tracking, VSE timelines | — | Stable |
| Background jobs | Long export or bake | PNG or multilayer EXR sequences with per-frame hashes, explicit missing-frame resume | Isolated from the live scene snapshot | Stable |
| Export | Approved scene | `.blend`, `.glb`, `.png`, H.264 `.mp4` plus receipts | FFmpeg and ffprobe required for video | Stable |

### Two connection modes

| Mode | Blender Add-on | Best for |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| **Managed — default** | Not required | Starting a fresh task with a non-invasive temporary Harness |
| **Connector** | Optional lightweight Add-on | Continuing work in an already-open Blender window |

Running-session truth comes from `capability.list` and `capability.describe`. The catalog is counted **per runtime mode**, generated from the command registry, and reproduced by `docs/verification/capability-counts.json`.

- **Managed** registers 196 commands: 175 at L3, 3 Windows-verified recovery and Rigify commands at L4, 18 at L1, and 0 at L2, across 35 domains, routed through 23 of the 38 bundled Skills.
- **Connector** adds the 5 optional `official_uploader.*` commands: 201 commands, 175 at L3, 3 at L4, 23 at L1, and 0 at L2, across 36 domains, routed through 24 Skills.

The two modes are never merged into a single count, and no combined coverage percentage is claimed. Foreground Windows UI takeover is not L4-verified. See the [runtime evidence](docs/verification/harness-runtime.md).

### Not responsible for

- Cloud login, pricing, submission, polling, and paid actions. Those stay outside this plugin.
- Bundling or installing the official jimeng uploader. It is user-enabled and, on the current macOS verification host, absent — so the Jimeng Web runtime gate is recorded as blocked even though its command and Skill contracts pass offline.
- Autodesk Maya. Maya is out of scope for this plugin.
- Foreground Windows UI takeover. Windows Server 2025 x64 / Blender 5.2.1 background recovery, Rigify, Named Pipe, and packaging passed the current L4 workflow; an interactive Windows desktop session remains unverified.

### Maturity

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Stable | Automated tests plus runtime evidence; usable for real work |
| Experimental | Behaviour may change; pin the version and verify before relying on it |
| Blocked / NOT_RUN | Not verified on this host; never present it as working |

### Bundled orchestration skills

| Skill | What it wraps | Tier-aware? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blender-design` | Milestone-based scene build from an idea | No — single-mode orchestrator |
| `blender-design-loop` | Closed dream → build → screenshot → critique → iterate loop against a target image; uses `scene.screenshot` + `blender-harness` JSON commands | Yes — Plus (low-quota, 3-round cap) vs Pro (judge subagent per round) |

Both skills are plugin-local (live under `./skills/`). They share
the `blender-harness` execution surface; neither duplicates it.

## Compatibility

| Plugin version | Host | Blender | Platform | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0.13.2` + runtime `0.7.0-rc.2` | Codex CLI or ChatGPT desktop app | Blender 4.2.23 CI baseline; visible Blender 5.2.1 UI acceptance | macOS Apple Silicon (UDS transport) | PASS |
| `0.13.2` + runtime `0.7.0-rc.2` | Codex CLI or ChatGPT desktop app | Blender 5.2.1 background L4 workflow | Windows Server 2025 x64 (Named Pipe transport) | PASS; foreground UI takeover not claimed |
| `0.13.2` + runtime `0.7.0-rc.2` | Codex CLI or ChatGPT desktop app | same | Linux headless (tokenized loopback TCP) | Experimental, not a release gate |

- **Managed** records 192 commands: 175 at L3, 3 Windows-verified recovery/Rigify commands at L4, 14 at L1, across 35 domains, routed through 23 Skills.
- **Connector** adds the 5 optional `official_uploader.*` commands: 201 commands, 175 at L3, 3 at L4, 23 at L1, and 0 at L2, across 36 domains, routed through 24 Skills.
Foreground Windows UI takeover is not L4-verified. Only the combinations in `docs/verification/harness-runtime.md` are claimed.

## Installation

### 1. Install Blender first

Download and install Blender from <https://www.blender.org/download/>, launch it once, and confirm the default cube appears. For video export, install FFmpeg and ffprobe and make sure both are on `PATH`.

> **No Blender yet? [Download the installer](https://www.blender.org/download/)**
>
> Open Blender, enable the MCP Add-on in **Preferences > Add-ons**, then press `N` and click
> **Start MCP Server**.

The trusted and only required Add-on is **PartMe Blender MCP** from the pinned upstream Release.
See the [illustrated first-use guide](docs/getting-started.md). Its integrated provider layer covers
the supported community asset/model services; do not install the separate **MCP for Blender**
Add-on alongside it.

### 2. Install the plugin

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add partme-ai/full-aigc-plugins
codex plugin add blender-design@partme-ai-blender
```

### 3. Connect an open Blender window (one-time setup)

The PartMe Blender MCP server is bundled with this Codex/ZCode/Kimi plugin. **Do not pip-install a
`partme-blender-mcp-*.tar.gz` bundle, and do not paste pip's `Processing ...` output back into the
shell.**

To attach to an open Blender window, install the bundled PartMe Add-on once. Ask Codex to “prepare
the Blender MCP installer”, or use this expert command:

```bash
python3 scripts/package_connector.py dist/partme-blender-mcp-addon-0.7.0-rc.2.zip
```

In Blender choose **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install from Disk**, select that ZIP, enable
**PartMe Blender MCP**, then press `N` in the 3D View and click **Start MCP Server** in the
**PartMe MCP** panel. This is the only one-time manual Blender-side step.

### Confirm it loaded

```bash
codex plugin list
```

Expected entry:

```text
blender-design@partme-ai-blender  installed, enabled
```

Then ask Codex to start managed mode and list capabilities. Running-session truth comes from the Harness itself:

```text
capability.list
capability.describe
```

The catalog is generated from the command registry, never hand-maintained, and counts are reproduced by `docs/verification/capability-counts.json`.

### Installing on ZCode

The same repository carries a ZCode adapter (`.zcode-plugin/plugin.json`, plugin id `blender`).

Local marketplace (fastest):

1. Create a marketplace folder with a `marketplace.json` pointing at this repository:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "partme-ai",
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "blender",
         "source": { "source": "directory", "path": "/absolute/path/to/partme-blender-plugin" },
         "category": "Creativity"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. ZCode → 设置 → 插件 → 创建 → 添加插件市场，填该 marketplace 文件夹路径。
3. 在「个人」分段安装 `blender`，新开会话。
4. The MCP bootstrap is zero-configuration: it discovers the active Blender session descriptor and `ffprobe` automatically. Advanced overrides remain available through the runtime environment when needed, but are not unresolved ZCode install-time variables.

Expected after install: `/blender` command group (9 slash commands), 33 skills, `plugin:blender:partme_blender` MCP server, and a SessionStart environment check.

### Installing on Kimi Code CLI

The same repository carries a Kimi adapter (`kimi.plugin.json`, plugin id `blender`). Kimi Code CLI
0.43.1 does not expose a plugin-manager command. Install the tagged repository in a stable local
directory, add its `skills/` directory to `extra_skill_dirs` in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, and merge
this server into the existing `mcpServers` object in `~/.kimi-code/mcp.json` without replacing other
servers:

```json
"partme_blender": {
  "command": "python3",
  "args": ["/absolute/path/to/blender-design-plugin/scripts/mcp_bootstrap.py"]
}
```

Run `kimi doctor`, then start a new session. Older Kimi builds that provide a supported plugin
manager may install `kimi.plugin.json` directly; follow the capabilities reported by the installed
client rather than assuming `/plugins` exists.

Expected after install: 33 skills (`/skill:blender-use` as the router), `blender:*` slash
commands, the `partme_blender` MCP server, and bundled hooks (SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit /
Stop).

### Hook trust note (Codex first enable)

The bundled `hooks/hooks.json` is a non-managed hook set. On first enable, Codex asks you to
review and trust it; the hooks are advisory-only (environment check, intent routing hint,
closeout reminder), always exit 0, and never block a turn.

### Install from the complete PartMe catalog

The supported catalog entry is the `partme-ai/full-aigc-plugins` marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add partme-ai/full-aigc-plugins
codex plugin add blender-design@partme-ai-blender
```

Notes:

- The plugin repository remains `full-aigc-plugins/blender-design-plugin`; the
  marketplace repository is `partme-ai/full-aigc-plugins`. They have different roles.
- For ZCode or Kimi, follow the manifests published by that marketplace instead of
  reusing a stale standalone-plugin URL.

## Quick start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Blender installed and launchable on this machine.
- FFmpeg and ffprobe on `PATH` when you need MP4 export.
- Python 3.13 available to the Harness (CI baseline).
- Enough disk space for checkpoint snapshots and frame sequences.

### 2. Start a managed session

Open a new Codex task and ask for a scene. A minimal prompt that exercises modeling, previews, and export:

```text
Use managed mode to start Blender. Create a matte-orange desktop speaker with a rounded body,
a black front grille, and one control knob. Show camera, front, side, and top previews.
When validation passes, export a new .blend, .glb, and .png into my output folder.
```

Expected observation: Blender launches, the Harness loads temporarily, milestone previews appear, and the export step reports a receipt with file hashes.

### 3. Continue in an open Blender window

Install the Connector Add-on, open your project, and ask Codex to attach. Pause and take over lets you edit directly; resuming forces a fresh scene inspection before Codex continues, so your manual edits are never overwritten by stale state.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CODEX_BLENDER_DESCRIPTOR` | Path to the Harness session descriptor | Written by the launcher |
| `CODEX_BLENDER_RUNTIME_DIR` | Override the runtime directory | Harness default |
| `CODEX_BLENDER_FFMPEG` | Override the FFmpeg binary | `ffmpeg` on `PATH` |
| `CODEX_BLENDER_FFPROBE` | Override the ffprobe binary | `ffprobe` on `PATH` |

### Configuration files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config/blender-release-matrix.json` | Which Blender versions are supported |
| `config/production-profile.json` | Domains and command classes excluded from the production catalog |

There are no API keys. Session authorization uses ephemeral HMAC tokens generated at session start with a 60-second default TTL, bound to a specific action.

## Harness contract

### Session lifecycle

| Phase | Input | Must complete | Failure semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `launch` | Blender path, runtime dir | Start Blender, load the Harness | Launch fails; no half-loaded session |
| `handshake` | Session descriptor | Authenticate and register capabilities | Session marked unavailable |
| `execute` | Structured command | Mutate on the main thread, bump scene revision | Returns a stable error code |
| `pause / takeover` | User action | Release control to the artist | Harness stays attached |
| `resume` | Continue request | Re-inspect the scene before mutating | Stale state is never applied |
| `shutdown` | Stop request | Flush checkpoints, close transport | Safe termination after timeout |

### Stable error codes

| Code | Meaning | Retryable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UNKNOWN_COMMAND` | Command is not in the registry | No |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Argument failed validation | No |
| `INVALID_COMMAND_DEFINITION` | Registry entry is malformed | No |
| `DUPLICATE_COMMAND` | Command name registered twice | No |
| `INVALID_COMMAND_RESULT` | Handler returned an invalid result | No |
| `UNKNOWN_CAPABILITY` | Capability not advertised by this session | No |
| `SESSION_REVOKED` | Authorization token rejected or expired | Re-authorize |
| `SESSION_CONTROL_CHANGED` | Another actor holds control | Resume with a fresh inspection |

Irreversible actions require action-bound authorization: `delete`, `overwrite`, `expert_python`, `path_escape`, `budget_exceeded`, and `recovery_resubmit`.

## Retry, idempotency, and recovery

- Request IDs prevent duplicate execution; scene revisions prevent stale writes.
- Milestone snapshots provide rollback evidence, and the transaction journal at `<runtime_dir>/recovery.json` drives non-restarting recovery.
- Background jobs are snapshot-isolated: they run against a committed scene state, expose status and cancellation, and never restart work on their own.
- Per-frame hashes make a missing frame detectable, so resume re-renders only what is missing.
- Authorization tokens are single-purpose and time-limited; an expired token fails closed rather than replaying an action.

## Data and state

| Data | Location | Lifecycle | Secrets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session descriptor | `<runtime_dir>/<session_id>.json` | Session scope; removed on clean shutdown | Ephemeral HMAC token only |
| Transaction journal | `<runtime_dir>/recovery.json` | Until the session completes or is discarded | None |
| Scene checkpoints | Runtime directory snapshot store | Until you delete them | None |
| Render outputs | Your chosen export directory | Until you delete them | None |
| Project sources | Your `.blend` and asset files | Never silently overwritten | None |

## Security

- Closed structured-command allowlist; arbitrary Python execution is disabled by default and requires explicit `expert_python` authorization.
- Blender data mutates only on the main thread, which prevents the class of corruption that background-thread writes cause.
- Transports are a private Unix domain socket on macOS, a Named Pipe on Windows, and tokenized loopback TCP only as a fallback.
- Authorization claims are HMAC-signed, TTL-limited, and bound to one action.
- Deletion, overwriting, format extension, and external actions all require action-bound authorization.
- The plugin bundles no credentials, and no credential is written to disk by the Harness.

## Development and verification

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
python3 scripts/validate_distribution.py .
```

Additional validators:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_document.py
python3 scripts/validate_model_in_blender.py
```

Recorded evidence:

- [Runtime evidence](docs/verification/harness-runtime.md) — the L3/L4/L1 breakdown for the local macOS baseline.
- [Windows L4 and Rigify evidence](docs/verification/windows-l4-rigify.md) — Windows Server 2025 x64 / Blender 5.2.1 background acceptance; it does not claim foreground UI takeover.
- [Official uploader runtime](docs/verification/official-uploader-runtime.md) — records `BLOCKED_MISSING_OFFICIAL_ADDON`.
- [Capability counts](docs/verification/capability-counts.json) — machine-checkable command inventory.
- `docs/verification/` also holds the domain coverage matrix, foreground lifecycle and policy records, and the acceptance test records.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check first | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blender does not launch | Blender installation and `PATH` | Install Blender and re-run managed mode |
| Video export fails | FFmpeg and ffprobe | Install both, or set `CODEX_BLENDER_FFMPEG` / `CODEX_BLENDER_FFPROBE` |
| Command returns `UNKNOWN_COMMAND` | `capability.list` for this session | Use an advertised command, or switch connection mode |
| Command returns `SESSION_REVOKED` | Authorization TTL | Re-authorize the action |
| Resume behaves unexpectedly | Manual edits since pause | Resume forces a fresh inspection by design; re-issue the intent |
| Jimeng Web route is unavailable | Official uploader presence | The uploader is user-installed; the gate stays blocked without it |
| Windows parity is expected | Platform evidence | Background recovery, Rigify, Named Pipe, and packaging are verified; foreground UI takeover still requires an interactive Windows acceptance run |
