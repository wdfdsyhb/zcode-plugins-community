# Connector Blender Session

Use when the user wants to continue the scene already open in Blender. Ask them to install the
generated Add-on zip once, enable **PartMe Blender MCP** in Preferences, open
`3D View → Sidebar → PartMe MCP`, and click **Start MCP Server**. Use `blender-mcp-setup` when
Blender or the connection is missing.

The Codex/ZCode/Kimi plugin already bundles the SHA-pinned PartMe runtime and the unmodified upstream Add-on.
Never ask an ordinary user to pip-install a platform archive. When the Add-on ZIP is needed, run
the bundled `scripts/package_connector.py` helper and present its output file; do not recreate or
fork the upstream implementation.

Read the private descriptor only after explicit start. **Revoke Access** invalidates the session.
If Blender switches to an unapproved file, stop mutations and require fresh authorization.
Connector and managed modes use the same commands and receipts.
