# Install and connect Blender Design

## Automatic connection (recommended)

After installing Blender and this plugin, just tell your AI agent: **"connect Blender"**. It calls
`blender_auto_setup`, which discovers your Blender installation, installs the **PartMe Blender MCP**
Add-on (pulling the latest package from GitHub Releases with a bundled offline fallback), enables it
persistently, launches Blender, and auto-starts the connector. The default approved output directory
is `~/partme/blender/design-outputs` (override with the `outputRoot` argument).

## Integrated asset and model providers

`blender_auto_setup` installs only **PartMe Blender MCP**. Its provider registry integrates
**Poly Haven / Sketchfab / Poly Pizza / Hyper3D Rodin / Hunyuan3D** without installing or starting
the separate community Add-on and without depending on port 9876. The compatibility tools
`blender_community_status` and `blender_community_call` retain their existing names, but they route
through the PartMe Add-on.

Poly Haven needs no key. Configure Sketchfab, Poly Pizza and Hunyuan credentials in the PartMe
Add-on preferences. Hyper3D supports two mutually exclusive modes: client-managed MCP OAuth for
free accounts, or a developer API Key. OAuth tokens remain in Codex or Claude Code and are never
copied into Blender preferences.

## Remote transports (optional)

The MCP server defaults to official-SDK stdio. Streamable HTTP is the preferred remote transport;
SSE remains a compatibility option. Credentials are read only from the environment:

```bash
PARTME_BLENDER_REMOTE_TOKEN='<token>' python3 scripts/mcp_bootstrap.py \
  serve-remote streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8901
```

For a non-loopback listener, also configure an HTTPS public URL, OAuth issuer URL and TLS certificate
in the PartMe Blender Add-on's **Access** tab settings. HTTP and SSE have independent lifecycles.

## Manual steps

> ### No Blender yet? [Download the installer](https://www.blender.org/download/)
>
> Open Blender, enable the MCP Add-on in **Preferences > Add-ons**, then press `N` in the 3D View and
> click **Start MCP Server**.

The trusted and only required Add-on for this plugin is **PartMe Blender MCP**. Do not install the
separate community **MCP for Blender** Add-on; PartMe provides the supported provider integrations
inside the guarded runtime.

## 1. Open Preferences

Choose **Edit > Preferences**.

## 2. Install and enable the Add-on

Choose **Add-ons > Install from Disk**, select `partme-blender-mcp-addon-0.7.0-rc.2.zip`, and enable
**PartMe Blender MCP**. The screenshot demonstrates the Add-ons location only; any community
Add-on name visible in an older screenshot is illustrative and must not be installed for this setup.

## 3. Start MCP Server

Return to the 3D View, press `N`, open **PartMe MCP**, select the approved output and asset directories,
and click **Start MCP Server**. Setup is complete only when `blender_connection_status` returns
`connected: true`.

The MCP adapter runs from the plugin's `.mcp.json`, exposes registered Harness commands as MCP tools,
and retains the Harness token, revision, transaction, authorization, and recovery boundaries.
