# Codex Blender Harness Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace the Dreamina-uploader adapter with a dual-mode, transactional Blender Harness that lets Codex design scenes and export verified files.

**Architecture:** A transport-neutral Harness core runs inside Blender and executes closed JSON commands on Blender's main thread. Managed bootstrap and Connector Add-on modes share the same session, command, transaction, preview, and export components. An external CLI adapter gives Codex and `codex-dreamina-3d` a stable argv + JSON contract.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3, Blender 5.x Python API, Unix Domain Sockets, Windows Named Pipes, loopback TCP fallback, JSON Schema, unittest, ffprobe.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-codex-blender-harness-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- macOS Apple Silicon and Windows x64 are release gates; Linux is experimental.
- Managed mode must not install or modify Blender preferences.
- Connector mode contains no Dreamina behavior.
- All mutations run on Blender's main thread through a queue.
- Unknown commands, stale revisions, duplicate non-idempotent requests, and path escapes fail closed.
- Destructive actions, overwrites, final export, and expert Python require action-bound authorization.
- No Jimeng/Dreamina link, credential, quote, submit, query, or paid-generation behavior remains.
- Existing user changes and unrelated worktree edits must be preserved.
