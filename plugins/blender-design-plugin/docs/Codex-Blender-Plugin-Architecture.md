## 1. Executive summary

Codex can already describe a scene in words. What it cannot do reliably is turn that description into a real Blender deliverable with evidence. This architecture defines a guarded local Harness that closes that gap: Codex plans, Blender executes a closed command registry, and every claim is backed by an artifact receipt.

The plugin optimises for three properties, in this order: the user's scene is never lost, every claim is backed by an artifact receipt, and the boundary between local Blender work and paid downstream generation is explicit rather than implied.

## 2. Drivers and constraints

The failure modes that drove this architecture were: an agent mutating a user's scene with no rollback path, claiming success from a command exit code rather than from a verified artifact, and mixing paid remote generation into a local modelling tool.

| Driver | Consequence for the architecture |
| --- | --- |
| A user's scene must never be lost | Main-thread-only mutation, milestone snapshots, rollback, and revision guards |
| Exit codes are not evidence | Fresh previews plus independent re-import and media probing before acceptance |
| Local work and paid work must not blur | No export implies a handoff, an upload, an authentication step, a quotation, or a paid action |
| Automation must not become arbitrary execution | A closed command registry, with expert Python disabled by default |

## 3. Scope and non-goals

`blender-design` owns Blender discovery and session creation or attachment; scene, object, modifier, material, camera, light, animation, preview, save, and export operations; milestone screenshots and review checkpoints; transaction snapshots, rollback, revision control, and audit records; and structured artifact receipts carrying size, `SHA-256`, parameters, and validation status.

It does not own Dreamina login, quotation, approval, submission, polling, paid generation, or final Dreamina artifact download. Those belong to `codex-dreamina-3d` and its companion design plugin. No Blender export implies a handoff, an upload, an authentication step, a quotation, or a paid action.

## 4. Context and trust boundary

```

The trust boundary sits at the local transport. Everything on the Codex side is untrusted input to Blender: it is parsed, validated against a closed command allowlist, and path-checked before it can reach a mutating operation. Blender never accepts a command that is not registered, and it never accepts a mutation that does not carry the scene revision it expects.

## 5. Current state, target state, and gaps

| Capability | Current | Target | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Managed mode on macOS Apple Silicon | Verified against recorded runtime evidence | Unchanged | None |
| Connector lifecycle on macOS | Verified | Unchanged | None |
| Model, raster, and H.264 exports | Verified, including re-import and probing | Unchanged | None |
| Transaction rollback under an injected failure | Verified | Unchanged | None |
| Windows x64 managed mode and Connector | `NOT RUN`; requires a Windows Blender host | Verified on Windows | Unrecorded on this host |
| Foreground Windows UI takeover | Non-L4-verified | Verified | Unrecorded |
| Official uploader runtime | `BLOCKED_MISSING_OFFICIAL_ADDON` | Available once the user installs it | User-installed dependency |
| Linux | Experimental, not a release gate | Unchanged | None |

This document claims only the combinations recorded in [harness-runtime.md](verification/harness-runtime.md).

## 6. Principles and decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Reversal condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mutate only on Blender's main thread | Off-thread writes corrupt scene data in ways that are hard to detect | None |
| Closed command registry instead of free-form Python | Makes every capability auditable and every argument schema-checked | None |
| Scene revision on every mutation | Prevents a stale plan from overwriting a newer scene | None |
| Snapshot before milestone work | A crash must be recoverable without replaying the whole session | None |
| Verify exports rather than trust exit codes | A writer can succeed while producing an unusable file | None |
| Keep paid work out of this plugin | The downstream plugin already owns approval and billing | None |

## 7. Components and dependencies

| Component | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `session.*` registry | capabilities, status, close, audit summary |
| Command guard | closed allowlist, revision check, path containment, authorization claim |
| Main-thread queue | queuing mutations and executing them on Blender's timer callback |
| Transaction engine | milestone snapshots, rollback, revision counters, recovery checkpoints |
| Preview engine | camera, front, side, and top screenshots plus animation sample frames |
| Export engine | format-specific writers, atomic receipt and status files |
| Visual evaluator | judging fresh images rather than trusting command success |
| Artifact validator | independent re-import and media probing of each export |

Dependencies point inward, from transport to protocol to core to Blender:

```text
transport (UDS / Named Pipe / loopback TCP)
  -> session handshake and protocol negotiation
    -> command guard
      -> main-thread queue
        -> command registry
          -> transaction, preview, and export engines
            -> Blender Python API
```

No engine reaches back into transport. No Blender data is touched off the main thread. The managed and Connector modes differ only in startup and transport discovery; they share the command registry, guardrails, transaction engine, preview engine, and export engine.

## 8. Runtime and core flows

### 8.1 Main flow

1. Codex converts a request into an implementation brief: supplied assets, required but missing assets, object and uniqueness constraints, scene and environment, camera route, animation beats, duration, output formats, and acceptance checks.
2. The session opens, negotiates `codex-blender/v1`, and registers capabilities.
3. A milestone begins with a lightweight snapshot and a persistent recovery checkpoint.
4. Mutating commands are queued, executed on the main thread, checked against `expectedSceneRevision`, and committed with a revision increment.
5. Each completed stage emits fresh camera, front, side, and top images plus a scene summary. Animation additionally emits first, middle, and last frames.
6. Codex evaluates the fresh images. Command success alone is not design acceptance.
7. On completion the plugin presents an artifact inventory — path, format, bytes, `SHA-256`, scene revision, snapshot, validation evidence, and unresolved deviations — and asks the user to either finish locally or explicitly request a handoff.

### 8.2 Runtime modes

**Managed mode** launches Blender and loads a temporary bootstrap script. No Blender preference and no Add-on installation is written. The process stays alive for the design session.

**Connector mode** is a lightweight Add-on exposing the same Harness inside an already-open Blender process. It reports connection status, start and stop, active-session identity, and a visible revoke control. It contains no Dreamina code and never enables arbitrary remote access.

### 8.3 Failure and recovery

| Failure | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Unregistered command | Fails closed; no dispatch |
| Stale `expectedSceneRevision` | Rejected before mutation |
| Duplicate non-idempotent `requestId` | Returns the prior response without re-executing |
| Path escaping an approved root | Rejected after canonical resolution |
| Mutation raising mid-transaction | Current transaction rolls back; restoration status is reported |
| Blender crash | Recovery reopens the last checkpoint and replays only committed idempotent commands |
| Validation failure | Stops for recovery rather than continuing the plan |
| Pause or takeover | Acts between commands, cancels queued work, invalidates active transactions and export approvals, and requires reinspection |

Rollback never reverts edits the user made by hand. Session revoke and loading a different file both stop the session.

## 9. Platforms, transport, and compatibility

| Platform | Status | Preferred transport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | release gate | Unix Domain Socket |
| Windows x64 | release gate | Named Pipe |
| Linux | experimental | tokenized loopback TCP |

Both release-gate platforms also support tokenized `127.0.0.1` TCP as a fallback. Every session uses a random 256-bit secret, restrictive socket or pipe permissions, idle expiry, request-size limits, and protocol-version negotiation.

| Dimension | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Blender | 5.2.1 LTS verified on the release-gate platforms |
| Protocol | `codex-blender/v1` |
| Model exports | `.blend`, `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.stl` |
| Raster exports | `.png`, `.jpg` |
| Video | H.264 `.mp4` via a verified frame sequence |
| Version-probed | EXR, USD, Alembic |
| Execution policy | `interactive`, `auto_with_budget`, `review_only` |

Omitted policy remains `interactive` for backwards compatibility.

## 10. Security and reliability budgets

- Closed command allowlist; unknown commands fail closed.
- No network listener outside the local transports; TCP binds only to loopback.
- Approved project, asset, and output roots are enforced after canonical path resolution, so symlinks and traversal cannot escape them.
- Requests and responses are size bounded, and secrets are never logged.
- Expert Python (`advanced.execute_python`) is disabled by default, statically scanned, network and subprocess restricted, checkpointed, hashed, audited, and executed only after an explicit action-bound authorization.
- The Connector stops accepting commands when Blender switches to an unapproved file.

| Budget | Value | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization token lifetime | 60 seconds, action-bound | A token authorizes one irreversible action, not a session |
| Session secret | Random 256-bit | A guessed secret would grant scene control |
| Request size | Bounded | Prevents an oversized payload from stalling the main thread |
| Idle session | Expires | An abandoned socket must not remain usable |
| Milestone approval binding | `sceneRevision` + snapshot id | The final export must use the approved revision |

Milestone approval binds `sceneRevision + snapshotId`, and the final export must use that bound revision. Long animation output is split so that frame production (`RENDER_ANIMATION_FRAMES`) and video composition (`COMPOSE_VIDEO`) are separate durable jobs; composition consumes only a complete, hash-verified `FrameSequenceReceipt`, and explicit resume reuses verified frames while replacing only missing or corrupt entries. Model exports are re-imported into an isolated scene for structural validation, and media outputs are probed independently.

## 11. Deployment, operations, and evolution

The plugin ships as a Codex/ZCode/Kimi plugin with platform manifests at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and the skills under `skills/`. There is no daemon and no installed service: Blender is launched on demand, and the Connector Add-on is installed by the user into their own Blender when they choose that mode.

### Observability

Every session exposes capabilities, status, and an audit summary. Each completed stage emits images that a human or an agent can re-inspect, and every export writes an atomic receipt alongside the artifact. The Connector panel shows the actual scene and session identity, the execution policy, the stage and progress reported by the caller, the last executed command, changed objects, and errors. Progress reported as a percentage is never promoted to verified completion.

### Evolution

The archived uploader-era design is not a fallback path; it is superseded. Future increments extend the command registry and the export contract rather than reintroducing Dreamina behaviour into this plugin. Animation-authoring upgrades, motion-quality evaluation, and background export workers are the next declared increments. Because the command contract is closed and versioned, adding a capability is an additive change to the registry plus its schema and tests.

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Scene loss | Main-thread discipline, snapshots, and verified rollback |
| Silent export corruption | Independent re-import and media probing |
| Platform overclaiming | Windows and Linux lines are published as `NOT RUN` and experimental |
| Scope creep toward paid features | The paid boundary is stated as a non-goal and enforced by the absence of the capability |

## 12. Evidence map

Runtime evidence is recorded under `docs/verification/`. The Harness runtime note in [harness-runtime.md](verification/harness-runtime.md) records the verified macOS Apple Silicon gates: managed foreground mode without Add-on installation, Connector lifecycle, main-thread dispatch, milestone previews, every model and raster export, H.264 `MP4`, transaction rollback with an injected failure, and independent model re-import validation.

It also records what is **not** accepted: Windows x64 managed mode and Connector runtime remain `NOT RUN` because they require a Windows Blender host. This document does not claim them.
