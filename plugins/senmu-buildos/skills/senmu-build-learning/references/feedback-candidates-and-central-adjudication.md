# Feedback Candidates and Central Adjudication

This standard is the intake boundary for BuildOS organizational learning. It lets agents submit high-signal BuildOS problems found in real projects to a local inbox for later user-triggered adjudication. It is not a user requirement pool, business-project inbox, board, analytics system, second project ledger, or automatic Skill editor.

## 1. What to Capture

A candidate must identify a BuildOS Skill, reference, template, script, Hook, rule, or runtime guidance and at least one real effect:

- Incorrect, conflicting, or misleading content caused a wrong decision, regression, or rework.
- Abstract, vague, or impractical content forced extra guessing or research.
- A rule, process, or default artifact created unnecessary work, over-implementation, or material inefficiency.
- The Skill conflicted with a real project, framework, or platform capability and had to be bypassed.
- Template/specification guidance produced an unclear, incomplete, or non-executable artifact.
- The same BuildOS-use failure recurred, showing that its true owner was not fixed.

Do not submit ordinary business requirements, feature bugs, project-specific facts, user product changes, general writing preferences, a one-off command typo, unverified hypotheses, or routine progress. A project issue qualifies only when the specific BuildOS content and resulting effect are identifiable.

## 2. One Capture Path

The agent using BuildOS decides and submits feedback; it does not infer a candidate from every user message. When a user says BuildOS is difficult, resolve the current request first, then test the BuildOS-target and real-effect criteria. If eligible, route through Learning:

Writing the local inbox is still a write. Submit only when current user/session authority permits that destination and action. A read-only or review-before-edit task reports the candidate in the requested output without silently writing the inbox, project log or source rules. Invocation and an available CLI do not expand authority.

```text
node <plugin-root>/hooks/feedback-cli.js submit \
  --component "<BuildOS Skill/reference/template/script/Hook>" \
  --summary "<problem>" \
  --impact "<error, confusion, extra work, inefficiency, or poor output>" \
  --project-root "<source-project-root>" \
  --evidence "<evidence-reference>" \
  --quiet
```

`--component` and `--impact` prevent business requests from masquerading as BuildOS feedback. `--evidence` may reference a session, file, command output, or workaround. `--quiet` emits no candidate ID or receipt. If the CLI is unavailable, do not claim the item was saved. Return only the minimum result when the user explicitly asks to query or process the inbox.

## 3. Local Inbox

The default inbox is `~/.senmu-buildos/feedback/`; `SENMU_BUILDOS_DATA_DIR` may select another local data root. The source project records where the problem occurred; the candidate is always feedback about BuildOS. Submission creates no business-project README, ledger, or governance structure, uploads nothing, and changes no Git state. An authorized handoff to a maintainer includes only selected necessary records, preserving candidate IDs and provenance. Raw evidence stays in approved private storage, not the product source or install directory. Record the resulting issue/commit/version in the existing decision owner; do not automatically upload the whole inbox or transcript.

Each candidate is an independent JSON file with a stable fingerprint to prevent duplicate writes of one event. Store only:

- candidate ID, time, source Harness, and signal type;
- local project root, session ID, and available transcript reference;
- BuildOS component, concrete impact, and a length-limited short summary redacted for common secret patterns.

Use `0600` for files and `0700` for directories on systems supporting POSIX permissions. Redaction reduces risk but is not complete DLP; never put secrets or customer data in the summary.

## 4. Central Adjudication

When the user asks to process or organize the BuildOS inbox:

1. Locate the plugin root from the loaded Skill. Run `node <plugin-root>/hooks/feedback-cli.js pending --summary` for count, components, source projects, and time range. `pending` (alias `unreviewed`) counts missing first decisions, not unresolved work. For follow-up review also inspect `all --summary` and `followup --summary`; the latter lists classified items that require checking their existing issue/task, without asserting that those owners are still open. Then page only the candidates needed with `--json --limit <n> --offset <n>`; do not load the entire inbox by default.
2. Cluster by root cause, scope, and specialist owner—not wording or count. If a current Skill already covers the decision, inspect whether the actual Harness, project entrypoint, script, validator, and behavior tests consume it. Wrong behavior despite existing prose usually indicates an execution-source gap, not a need to repeat the rule. For chat-derived candidates or reports, a final summary is candidate evidence only: retrieve relevant original turns as needed to verify premises, user corrections, alternatives, and evidence against project/runtime facts. User statements are important input but not automatically verified facts; neither read the whole transcript mechanically nor rely only on the final answer.
3. Propose exactly one disposition per group: `discard`, `project`, `buildos_candidate`, or `needs_evidence`, with rationale.
4. Resolve any material classification or abstraction choice not already covered by the user's request. Existing authority to adjudicate and make scoped source corrections remains valid; processing an inbox alone grants no project, source, install or release authority.
5. Write the decision receipt with `feedback-cli.js decide` only within current write authority. Reuse the actual decision and its provenance instead of requesting a second generic approval. Preserve the original candidate; do not rewrite history by deletion.

Minimum commands:

```bash
node <plugin-root>/hooks/feedback-cli.js pending --summary
node <plugin-root>/hooks/feedback-cli.js pending --json --limit 10 --offset 0
node <plugin-root>/hooks/feedback-cli.js decide --id <FB-id> --disposition <value> --note "<reason>"
```

## 5. Post-Adjudication Boundaries

- `discard`: verified noise, an out-of-scope non-actionable observation, or a duplicate with its existing owner identified. Existing prose alone does not justify discard: check whether the actual project, adapter, template, script or test consumes it. Unknown causes remain `needs_evidence`.
- `project`: specific to the source project; return it to requirement, architecture, implementation, process, or delivery authority without copying prose into the BuildOS inbox.
- `needs_evidence`: record the required reproduction, verification, or second-project sample; do not execute it as a durable rule.
- `buildos_candidate`: independent input to the BuildOS source project, implemented under BuildOS source-change authority with whole-repository impact analysis and matching tests; installation and release need their applicable authority.

A first decision classifies intake; it is not implementation completion. Link accepted/project/needs-evidence items to the existing issue/task, using `decide --tracking-ref <reference>` when recording a new decision. Preserve old decisions and raw candidates; do not re-decide or delete them to change a completion count. The linked owner records `pending`, `not adopted` with rationale, or `resolved` with the matching commit/version and actual verification. Source fixed, installed, deployed and user-observed recovery are separate facts. Without access to the local inbox or the linked owner's current state, report that limit; never infer "all solved" from zero undecided candidates.

An optional scheduled task may read pending candidates and propose adjudication. It must never modify or publish BuildOS without human review.
