# Organizational Learning

Keep raw feedback, candidate lessons, project rules, and formal BuildOS rules in distinct states. Resolve ordinary corrections in the current task. Load this skill only for inbox review, formal retrospectives, lesson promotion, or knowledge distillation.

## Route by Outcome

- Submit or review feedback candidates: [Feedback Review](references/feedback-candidates-and-central-adjudication.md).
- Retrospect, deduplicate, promote, or retire resolved lessons: [Organizational Learning](references/organizational-learning-and-governance-closure.md).
- Promote cross-project improvements into BuildOS: [BuildOS Evolution](references/buildos-evolution-and-upstream-feedback.md).
- Absorb external Skills/knowledge after current model and host calibration: [Knowledge Distillation](references/engineering-knowledge-distillation-and-standard-promotion.md).

Run the project's validator when modifying formal Lessons Learned. Raw feedback does not need a Lessons ID.

## Core Contract

1. **Capture:** Use the local CLI only when BuildOS use in a real project shows that a skill, reference, template, script, hook, or rule caused error, misdirection, execution difficulty, empty guidance, unnecessary work, or inefficiency. Do not capture business requests or ordinary corrections automatically.
2. **Review:** Deduplicate by root cause and classify as `discard`, `project`, `buildos_candidate`, or `needs_evidence`.
3. **Promote:** Calibrate against current official guidance for the target model and host. Absorb useful domain capability without importing obsolete prompting workarounds or process overhead. Keep project-specific rules with their owner; promote cross-project meaning with scoped evidence.

Record the component, concrete impact, and evidence or workaround. Dissatisfaction can start a candidate but a vague opinion is insufficient; frequency is not a mechanical threshold. Correct the source within existing write authority; read-only retrospectives deliver evidence and recommendations without changing the reviewed object. For verified rework or owner corrections, use the Organizational Learning reference for lightweight classification in existing records. Do not add prompts, validators, or approvals for every mistake or duplicate a rule across skills, inboxes, logs, and lessons.

Handoff disputed facts or causes to Assurance and customer requirements to Product. Learning owns knowledge lifecycle, not domain facts or Git/release authorization.
