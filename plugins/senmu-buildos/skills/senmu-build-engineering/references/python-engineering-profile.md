# Python Engineering Profile

This profile adds Python-specific decisions only. [Source-Code Quality and AI Collaboration](source-code-quality-and-ai-collaboration.md) owns general responsibility, dependencies, errors, review, and AI collaboration; [Software Testing and Quality Verification](software-testing-and-quality-verification.md) owns test scope/evidence; [Implementation Economy and Overengineering](implementation-economy-and-overengineering.md) owns abstraction/platform/configuration justification.

Load this profile for `.py`, `.pyi`, notebooks, Python dependencies, or `pyproject.toml` only when project rules are missing or standards review is explicit. Current project rules, minimum Python version, and tool configuration prevail.

## 1. Versions, Packages, and Dependencies

- Determine minimum Python from `pyproject.toml`, images, CI, or authority—not the agent environment. Do not use newer syntax or standard-library APIs.
- A Python upgrade synchronizes CI, deployment images, type checker, lockfiles, and framework compatibility, not just a version declaration.
- Evaluate `src/` layout for new installable libraries or stable import boundaries; retain better layouts for one-file tools, framework conventions, and legacy apps.
- Maintain dependencies/version ranges in the project's selected owner. Do not let `requirements*.txt`, lockfiles, and `pyproject.toml` conflict.
- Avoid durable dumping grounds such as `utils.py`, `helpers.py`, or `common.py`; name modules for domain or technical boundaries.

## 2. Format, Naming, and Imports

- New projects may default to Ruff formatter/linter. Preserve stable Black, isort, Flake8, Pylint, or other combinations in existing projects unless migration is in scope.
- Put width, target version, and rule set in project configuration so formatting has one result. Do not mix repository-wide formatting into a business change.
- Use `snake_case` for modules/functions/methods/variables, `PascalCase` for classes/exceptions, `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants, and suffix exception classes `Error`.
- Use one leading underscore for internal APIs. Prefer predicate names such as `is_`, `has_`, `can_`, and `should_`.
- Avoid shadowing built-ins such as `list`, `dict`, `str`, and `id`; avoid wildcard imports in ordinary business code.
- Group standard-library, third-party, and project imports. Local imports require a real reason—cycle, optional dependency, startup cost—and a clear boundary.
- Do not patch `sys.path` to conceal package defects. Importing a module must not start services, access networks, or write files; put script actions in `main()` behind `if __name__ == "__main__"`.

## 3. Data Model and Abstraction

- Never use mutable defaults such as `items=[]`; default to `None` and create the object inside.
- Model stable business parameters and results explicitly using existing project types. A lightweight dataclass or TypedDict may describe a fixed structure; genuine dynamic mappings may remain typed mappings. Use runtime parsing/validation at trust boundaries, with Pydantic or equivalent only when the selected framework or contract calls for it. Type annotations and TypedDict do not validate incoming data at runtime. Do not hide required business fields or incompatible state payloads in an unstructured dictionary, but do not wrap every local mapping in a new model class.
- Prefer a small Protocol, callable or explicit interface for structural substitution. An abstract base class is also appropriate for a required nominal/framework contract, abstract-member instantiation enforcement, or shared implementation/state. Choose the existing ecosystem mechanism for the actual boundary, not an Interface/Impl ceremony or a fixed count of implementations.
- Do not import Interface/Impl, Factory, or Manager ceremony mechanically. Metaclasses, descriptors, dynamic injection, and monkey patching require a framework contract or verified benefit and an isolated boundary.
- Properties must be cheap, predictable, and free of material side effects. Use methods for remote calls, expensive work, and state mutation.
- ORM, API, domain, and third-party models should not share one role indefinitely. Add explicit conversion when boundary differences create real errors or maintenance cost.

## 4. Types

- Type public functions, data models, and external boundaries accurately. In legacy work, cover new code and core boundaries first, then tighten incrementally.
- Keep `Any` in irreducibly dynamic/third-party adapters. Scope `cast()`, `# type: ignore[...]`, and `# noqa` narrowly with a specific code and reason.
- Type syntax must support the minimum Python version.
- Distinguish nullable values from omitted/defaulted parameters; `None` must not represent several business states.
- Prefer `Enum`, `Literal`, or constrained models for finite states over scattered strings.
- Pyright is a reasonable default. Preserve an established mypy/tool-plugin owner; do not introduce a second checker for duplicate noise.

Types prove structure, not valid amounts, permissions, state transitions, or data ownership; runtime contracts own those.

## 5. Docstrings and Language

Internal projects default to English identifiers and Simplified Chinese business comments/docstrings. International open-source, public SDK, and multinational projects follow project language; never mix randomly within a module.

- Document public modules, classes, functions, and methods. Do not add empty ceremonial prose to short self-explanatory private functions.
- Use `"""` and one project style. Google-style `Args`, `Returns`, and `Raises` is an acceptable default. Explain business meaning, preconditions, side effects, idempotency, and errors without duplicating types.
- Comments explain complex branching, compatibility, transactions, concurrency, retries, performance, or security tradeoffs—not line-by-line behavior.
- Update or remove comments with implementation; do not retain commented-out old code.

```python
def settle_order(order_id: str) -> SettlementResult:
    """结算指定订单。

    同一订单重复调用不会重复记账；只有已支付订单能够进入结算流程。

    Args:
        order_id: 订单唯一标识。

    Returns:
        本次结算结果；已经结算的订单返回原结果。

    Raises:
        OrderNotFoundError: 订单不存在。
        InvalidOrderStateError: 订单状态不允许结算。
    """
```

The Chinese example is retained deliberately to specify the default internal documentation language, not as a parallel runtime rule.

## 6. Python Boundary Conditions

- Catch specific exceptions you can handle. Catch broad `Exception` only at clear process, job, or HTTP boundaries; preserve causes with `raise NewError(...) from exc`.
- Manage files, connections, transactions, locks, and sessions through `with`, `async with`, or framework lifecycles. Use `sys.exit()` only at program entry.
- Do not run blocking network/file operations directly on async paths. Use async clients, a thread boundary, or a job queue with timeouts, cancellation, and cleanup.
- Use timezone-aware values across regions/persistence. Use `Decimal` or integer minor units for money, never binary floating-point settlement.
- Prefer `pathlib`; validate user paths for traversal and authorization boundaries.
- Parse, validate, and convert external JSON, messages, files, and database rows at boundaries. Do not let arbitrary dictionaries permeate domain logic.
- Module-level mutable state, caches, and connections require explicit owner, lifetime, concurrency semantics, and test reset.

## 7. Tests and Tooling

- New projects may default to pytest; preserve project test layout, naming, fixtures, and import mode.
- New `src/` projects may evaluate `--import-mode=importlib`; before changing legacy projects, verify plugins, relative imports, and test entrypoints.
- Unit tests never call real networks, production databases, or paid services. Use project-defined isolated environments and markers for such boundaries.
- Without an existing owner, Ruff formatter/linter, Pyright, and pytest are a reasonable start. Keep actual arguments in `pyproject.toml`, not a duplicated document configuration.
- Local quick checks and CI use the same configuration. Common forms are `ruff format --check .`, `ruff check .`, `pyright`, and `python -m pytest`, but project commands prevail.

## 8. Legacy Migration

- Establish a baseline, then apply minimum rules to new/changed scope. Separate repository-wide formatting, import sorting, and mass typing from behavior changes.
- Retire historical suppressions incrementally; never globally disable unknown warnings merely for green CI. Exceptions need reason, scope, and closeout condition.
- Query current official sources when Python, framework, or tool details may have changed; this profile does not freeze volatile option catalogs.
- Repeated framework-specific rules belong in project/framework authority, not an ever-growing general Python profile.

For a missing quality-command connection, adapt the [executable adoption examples](../assets/code-quality/examples/README.md). Reuse current tools and prove a valid path, expected violation and restoration in disposable scope; examples are not installed project policy.
