# Interface Copy and Content Design

This standard owns durable cross-page buttons, labels, states, errors, guidance, empty states, and AI-generated interface content. It does not replace a project's design system, glossary, or brand voice, or turn one translation or routine copy edit into product governance.

## 1. Precedence

Apply: approved product behavior and business facts > project terminology, brand voice, and design system > target-platform convention > these defaults. Platform capitalization, button order, and familiar labels may vary, but never weaken truthfulness, action outcome, risk, or recovery.

When no content owner exists, store durable terminology, object names, and voice in the existing product specification or design system. Do not create a BuildOS copy ledger that must stay synchronized. Keep campaign copy, marketing titles, and project-specific business terms in the project.

## 2. Shared Principles

- **Name the user's task.** Use familiar objects, actions, and outcomes.
- **Lead with the material result.** State what happened, what it affects, and the next action; defer cause, limits, and technical detail.
- **Use one name per concept.** Keep entry actions, titles, object names, states, and feedback consistent.

- If terminology ambiguity changes behavior or acceptance, resolve it under [Requirements and Product Iteration](product-requirements-and-iteration.md#3-from-requirement-to-version-prd); interface copy consumes that decision and does not create a competing glossary.
- **Be concise but complete.** Remove pleasantries, repetition, and decoration, not scope, consequence, recovery, or relevant limits.
- **Match tone to fact.** State ordinary results without unrelated celebration, emotion, or unsupported promises. Clarity and truth precede brand voice.
- **Do not rely on visuals alone.** Essential actions/states need text or an accessible name, not color, position, or icon alone.

For substantive rewriting or proofreading, use [Writing](../../senmu-build-engineering/references/technical-documentation-writing.md) only when needed for editing scope, fact preservation or protected literals. Product retains content and behavior authority; a local meaning-preserving correction does not activate product governance.

## 3. Actions and Buttons

Prefer a verb or verb plus object that identifies the result, such as “Save settings,” “Submit for review,” or “Delete project.” Avoid “Click here” and explanatory sentences used as actions.

Use generic navigation labels only when flow and consequences are clear:

| Role | Boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Next | enters a defined next step; does not complete the business action |
| Continue | resumes or advances a flow whose destination is clear |
| Done | the last step is complete; no later submit/confirm remains |
| Back | returns without implying save, cancel, or submit |
| Cancel | exits an unapplied action; draft retention follows product facts |
| OK | confirms known information only; use the business action when one exists |
| Got it | acknowledges reading only; never saves, deletes, submits, or releases |

For dangerous or irreversible actions, name the actual action and object and state the primary consequence. Put required warnings before the risky action, not after it as a result-first explanation. Never use “OK” as the sole primary label. Buttons, labels, headings, menus, and short column headers normally omit terminal punctuation.

## 4. Status, Errors, and Feedback

- **Success:** avoid redundant notifications when the result is already visible; otherwise name the completed action and affected object.
- **In progress:** describe the user's task and product-visible state. Approved product concepts such as a selected model or visible queue may be named when useful; do not expose unrelated implementation stages or invent progress percentages. State off-page continuation, cancellation and expected delay only when true.
- **Error:** state the action that could not complete, give an actionable known cause, then recovery. “Operation failed,” “invalid parameter,” or an internal code alone is incomplete.
- **Empty:** explain why content is absent and offer a primary action only when a reasonable one exists; do not fill space with feature marketing.
- **Confirmation:** interrupt only for material consequences, likely mistakes, or difficult recovery. Name object, consequence, and continuation; avoid confirmation for ordinary reversible actions.

Primary messages use the product's approved terminology, including technical objects the user actually operates. Exclude secrets, raw internal prompts, stack traces and irrelevant implementation details. Put necessary diagnostics in a redacted, expandable, copyable area; do not hide an approved model, queue, API field or public price solely because it is technical or commercial.

Distinguish transport success, business acceptance, job state and the displayed message. `Accepted` is not necessarily completed; `Pending` is not necessarily processing. Choose language from the approved state model, not a fixed word mapping. Timeout alone does not prove failure or absence of side effects. Preserve codes/enums and use only the supported recovery path; “暂不支持” must not invent a roadmap promise.

## 5. Generated Interface Content

Generated copy remains subject to product facts and this standard. Reject observable output that:

- narrates the model's work or adds conversational pleasantries;
- exposes paraphrased requirements, acceptance notes, or internal discussion;
- states planned, unknown, or unconfirmed outcomes as completed, guaranteed, or always available;
- replaces a clearly nameable action or error with a long explanation.

Before delivery, check object names, action outcomes, state truth, error recovery, and separation of internal information across the interface.

## 6. Language and Platform Profiles

For Chinese, read [Chinese Interface Copy](chinese-interface-copy.md); for English, read [English Interface Copy](english-interface-copy.md). Read each target profile separately for multilingual products. Localize intent and result rather than word order, capitalization, length, or fragments.

Follow established mobile, web, and enterprise conventions unless they obscure action, consequence, or recovery. Component defaults are usable defaults, not automatic product standards.

For an established product, inventory inconsistencies in objects, actions, states, errors, and guidance from the real interface and project owners, then update the single terminology/product owner. Do not add a permanent approval workflow or second checklist for the exercise.
