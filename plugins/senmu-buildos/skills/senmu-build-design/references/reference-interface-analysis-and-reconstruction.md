# Reference Interface Analysis and Reconstruction

Use this standard to turn a screenshot, URL, design file, or existing interface into an implementable specification. It supports faithful reconstruction or adaptation of a design language without importing the reference's product behavior, data, brand facts, or stack.

## 1. Choose the Outcome

- **Reconstruction:** match observable structure, proportions, visual relationships, responsive behavior, and key states. Mark unknown behavior; never invent it from a screenshot.
- **Design translation:** preserve hierarchy, rhythm, material, or interaction language while adapting content, brand, components, and user tasks.
- **Pattern extraction:** retain only reusable page structures, component patterns, or visual relationships rather than treating the whole page as a template.

Target product specifications, design owners, real content, and component ecosystem take precedence. References provide design evidence and candidates, not project facts.

## 2. Layered Analysis

Acquire the minimum surface that changes the decision: target viewport, first screen and long page, before/after interaction states, mobile differences, and necessary assets. Keep unobservable behavior unknown.

Separate observation from intended implementation across:

1. information and reading order: primary task/action, narrative order, density, scroll rhythm;
2. spatial structure: containers, grids, alignment, whitespace, proportions, sections, overlap, viewport relations;
3. visual language: type roles, color hierarchy, surfaces, borders, shadows, radius, images, icons;
4. components/states: navigation, cards, forms, lists, overlays, selection, feedback, visible state differences;
5. responsive/input: reflow, collapse, density, touch/pointer differences, content priority;
6. motion: purpose, trigger, rhythm, entry/exit, scrolling, focus, state changes, reduced-motion path.

With only a static screenshot, treat motion, hover, keyboard, and error states as unknown. An accessible URL does not establish every authentication, device, or data state.

## 3. Implementation Specification

Include what the task needs from:

- hierarchy, region order, layout constraints, and key dimensional relationships;
- semantic roles for typography, color, space, radius, borders, shadows, and motion;
- component composition, content rules, and applicable states;
- desktop, mobile, and intermediate-width priority/reflow;
- reusable, newly required, and substitute assets;
- observations, inferences, conflicts, unknowns, and items requiring user/runtime confirmation;
- target viewports, key states, and observable comparison criteria.

Product decides changes to function, content, permission, and business state. Project/Engineering or specialist skills own React, Ant Design, shadcn, GSAP, and other implementation APIs. Design specifies results rather than maintaining framework APIs.

## 4. Conditional Design Library

Read [Design Library Index](design-library/INDEX.md) only when the reference is incomplete, the user requests exploration, or observations must become a reusable pattern. Load one matching resource pack. The library supplies candidates; do not rotate themes, fill quotas, or mix conflicting languages.

## 5. Verification and Ownership

For implemented reconstruction, compare affected target viewports with real content and key states: hierarchy, proportions, wrapping, density, crop, responsiveness, and interaction feedback. Static code, one screenshot, or component presence cannot establish interactive behavior. Direction-only analysis may finish with observed evidence, implementable decisions, and explicit limits; it does not require building a prototype.

Reference analysis does not become the design owner. Keep one-off results in the task. Write only approved, stable cross-page rules into the existing design system, tokens, component standard, or registered owner. Create a minimum design baseline only when no owner exists and durable need is confirmed.
