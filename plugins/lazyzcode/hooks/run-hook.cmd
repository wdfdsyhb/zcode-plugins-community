@echo off
rem lzy hook launcher (Windows twin of the POSIX `run-hook`, one manifest line across both
rem platforms): the engine spawns hook commands with its own env, whose PATH is not guaranteed
rem to resolve node (2026-09-07 macOS GUI-startup incident; Windows keeps the same contract).
rem Usage (hooks.json): "${ZCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run-hook" <script.js> [args...]
rem   cmd.exe resolves the extensionless name to this .cmd twin via PATHEXT
rem   (docs/design-crossplatform.md §1; schema has no per-OS fields).
rem Discipline: when node cannot be resolved, log one line to %TEMP%\lzy-hook-launcher.log and
rem   exit 0 (fail-open, never block the session). Mirrors the extensionless POSIX twin
rem   `run-hook`, including --print-node.
rem Style note: goto flow throughout - %PATH%/%APPDATA% may contain parentheses (x86) which
rem   would break parse-time expansion inside parenthesized blocks; no delayed expansion either.
rem nvm candidate order (V021-ADJ-57): the wildcard's last match used to win, but plain name
rem   order puts a v9 residue after v24 ("v9" > "v2x" bytewise) => Node 9 ran the ESM hooks and
rem   all six hooks died with no fail-open log on that path. Now every %APPDATA%\nvm\* dir is
rem   scored by its v<major>.<minor>.<patch> name through a zero-padded sort key (equal-width
rem   digits => string compare == version compare) and the highest one wins. Fallback semantics
rem   when a dir name carries no parseable version: the dir is SKIPPED as a candidate (ADJ-23,
rem   v023-fix-round: a letter-leading padded key would beat every numeric key under IF string
rem   compare, inverting the documented order); with no nvm candidate at all
rem   the fixed system path below is used. The chosen binary stays observable via --print-node
rem   (lzy doctor hook-node row).
