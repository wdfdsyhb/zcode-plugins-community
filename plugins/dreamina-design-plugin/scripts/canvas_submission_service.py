"""Canvas submission service: quote-bound approval for the Canvas runtime.

This is the Canvas counterpart of ``ImageService`` / ``VideoService``. It
deliberately does not modify those services: the frozen ``dreamina`` rail
stays exactly as it was, and this module sits beside it as the second
runner behind the same MCP surface.

The one structural improvement Canvas allows is the approval ordering.
The legacy CLI could only estimate cost before submitting, so an approval
bound an estimate. Canvas quotes a *live* amount for a saved draft, so the
approval here is bound to that quote:

    quote()  : prepare() → live quote → fingerprint + scope (with the ceiling)
    submit() : consume_approval(fingerprint) → node confirm → node run

Accounting is identical to the legacy rail: the same ``ApprovalGuard``
receipt and the same ``OperationLedger`` intents, so submit-once, ambiguity
handling and no-blind-resubmission guarantees carry over unchanged.
