"""Router Skill code path for ``dreamina-design-use``.

This module backs the router Skill. It does *not* embed any prompt or
CLI invocation body — it only selects between the packaged Skills and
enforces the anti-patterns called out in the plan:

* refuse ambiguous routing (multiple matches);
* refuse hard-coded catalogs;
* require explicit approval binding;
* require web-prerequisite acknowledgement for the first video;
* require submit-ID query before any blind resubmission.

The additive ``video_project`` intent routes to the project orchestrator Skill.
It is a separate intent so it cannot change any existing image or video route.

The router deliberately defers to ``scripts/verify_skill_snapshot`` to
prove every packaged Skill is byte-identical to the verified upstream
commit before any routing decision is allowed.

Sunset boundary
---------------
The ``dreamina`` binary this plugin's adapter drives (see
``scripts/dreamina_adapter.py``) stops being maintained after 2026-11.
The routes below therefore keep pointing at the frozen classic Skills —
that is the only path this plugin can still execute — but they are no
longer the recommended default for new work. ``CANVAS_SUCCESSORS`` maps
every intent to its successor in ``dreamina-canvas-plugin`` 0.4.0
(``dreamina-canvas-cli*``), and ``canvas_successor`` returns that pair so
callers and documentation can state the migration explicitly instead of
routing silently into a dying path. Porting the adapter itself is tracked
as separate work and is out of scope for this module.
