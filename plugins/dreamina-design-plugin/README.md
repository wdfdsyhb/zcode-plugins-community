## Positioning

`dreamina-design` exposes the official Dreamina CLI to supported coding-agent hosts through a local stdio MCP server with 22 typed tools. Every paid call passes a server-side confirmation, every submission gets a stable `submit_id`, and every task is queried before it is ever resubmitted.

The plugin is a strict wrapper: the CLI owns authentication and the remote API, model parameters come from the live CLI schema, and no tool accepts arbitrary shell input.

### Who it is for

- Designers and marketers who want image and video generation inside their coding agent without losing control of spend.
- Engineers who need a typed, auditable MCP surface over a vendor CLI.
- Reviewers who need an approval record and a resumable submission identity for every paid action.

### What problem it solves

| Problem | What this plugin provides | Verifiable entry point |
|---|---|---|
| CLI options drift | Capability snapshot and CLI status tools read the live CLI | `dreamina_capability_snapshot`, `dreamina_cli_status` |
| Paid calls happen by accident | A native confirmation dialog whose default action is Cancel | `scripts/native_approval.py` |
| Ambiguous results invite duplicates | Query by `submit_id`; never mint a replacement | `scripts/operation_ledger.py` |
| Untrusted CLI binaries | Trust enrollment with an absolute path, owner check, and SHA-256 | `scripts/trusted_cli.py` |

## Capabilities and boundaries

### Supported

| Capability | Input | Output | Limit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Capability discovery | A live CLI | Verified capability snapshot and CLI status | Read-only | Stable |
| CLI management | Install or upgrade request | Verified installation from the fixed HTTPS installer | Requires approval | Stable |
| Authentication | OAuth request | Login, check, relogin, or logout | Requires approval | Stable |
| Image generation | An approved request | One submitted image task | Consumes credits | Stable |
| Video generation | An approved request | One submitted video task | Consumes credits; some modes require web-side prerequisites | Stable |
| Visual quality loop | Locked visual target plus one approved generation request | Content-bound round receipt and independent Judge result | The first round never auto-retries; default retry limit is one and requires an exact allowance | Local contract verified |
| Reference-video project | Source video, redesign and a closed batch quote | Durable analysis, generation, evaluation, composition and export receipts | Paid execution remains approval-bound | Production MCP chain registered |
| Task handling | A `submit_id` | Status and optional verified download | Query-only; never resubmits | Stable |
| Session management | Session request | Create, list, search, rename, delete | Requires approval for writes | Stable |
| Diagnostics | A log request | Bounded, redacted CLI log excerpt | Read-only | Stable |
| Reference-video project | Project workflow request | Versioned project, quote, execution, composition, export | The new project tools are recorded `NOT_RUN` at runtime | Experimental |

### Not responsible for

- Owning authentication. The `dreamina` CLI owns it; this repository wraps it through an argv-only adapter.
- Deciding to spend. Only an explicit approval, confirmed in a native dialog, releases a paid call.
- Bypassing web-only prerequisites. When a video mode needs something done on the web, the plugin reports it.
- Retrying submissions. An uncertain result is queried by `submit_id`, never resubmitted.
- Arbitrary shell or argv execution. No tool exposes a free-form command.

### Maturity

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Stable | Automated tests plus recorded runtime evidence |
| Experimental | Contract is still evolving; the runtime gate is `NOT_RUN` |
| Blocked / NOT_RUN | Not verified; never present it as available |

## Legacy CLI sunset — plan your Canvas migration

The `dreamina` binary stops being maintained after **2026-11**. As of 0.7.0
this plugin runs a **dual rail**: the paid submit tools default to the Canvas
runtime (`dreamina-canvas` CLI, quote-bound approval), and `runtime: "legacy"`
keeps the frozen `dreamina` path for as long as it exists. `scripts/router_skill.py`
still maps every frozen intent to its Canvas successor via
`Router.canvas_successor()`; with the adapter ported, the successor table below
is now executable through this plugin's own Canvas rail:

| Intent | Frozen route (still executed) | Canvas successor |
|---|---|---|
| text-to-image | `dreamina-cli-text2image` | `dreamina-canvas-cli-text2image` |
| image-to-image | `dreamina-cli-image2image` | `dreamina-canvas-cli-image2image` |
| text-to-video | `dreamina-cli-text2video` | `dreamina-canvas-cli-text2video` |
| image-to-video / frames / multi-frame / multimodal | `dreamina-cli-*` | `dreamina-canvas-cli-ref2video` (Canvas has no `i2v`) |
| speech | — | `dreamina-canvas-cli-text2voice` |
| music | — | `dreamina-canvas-cli-text2audio` |

### Canvas runtime (default)

`dreamina_submit_image` / `dreamina_submit_video` accept:

- `runtime` — `canvas` (default) or `legacy`.
- `project_id` — reuse a canvas; omit it and pass `canvas_name` to create one
  (canvas creation is a remote write and asks for its own approval).
- `credit_ceiling` — optional; defaults to the ceiling quoted for the saved draft.

The Canvas rail quotes the saved draft first, binds the approval fingerprint to
that live amount, then runs `node confirm → node run → operation wait` with a
stable `submitId`. Enrollment for the Canvas binary is separate:
`~/.config/dreamina-design/trusted-canvas-cli.json` (same 0600 contract as the
legacy trust store). See `docs/canvas-runtime.md`.

## Compatibility

| Plugin version | Host | CLI | Python | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0.7.0` | Any MCP client with stdio support | `dreamina-canvas` CLI enrolled and trusted | 3.13 | Dual-rail port: submit tools default to the Canvas runtime (quote-bound approval, projectId/canvas_name/credit_ceiling), `runtime: legacy` keeps the frozen path; router successor table is now executable |
| `0.7.0` | 任意支持 stdio 的 MCP 客户端 | 已注册并信任的 `dreamina-canvas` CLI | 3.13 | 双轨移植：提交工具默认 Canvas 运行时（报价绑定审批，新增 projectId/canvas_name/credit_ceiling），`runtime: legacy` 保留冻结路径；路由继任表已可执行 |
| `0.6.2` | Any MCP client with stdio support | `dreamina` CLI installed from the official installer and trusted | 3.13 | Declares the legacy-CLI sunset boundary: `router_skill.py` now maps every frozen route to its `dreamina-canvas-cli*` successor (name + install hint); frozen execution path unchanged until the adapter is ported |
| `0.6.1` | Any MCP client with stdio support | `dreamina` CLI installed from the official installer and trusted | 3.13 | Upstream re-vendor at `dreamina-skills` 4e776ac (v1.7.0): 17 vendored Skills refreshed, frozen classic CLI and Prompt/OpenCLI behaviour unchanged; declared `dreamina-video-shots` / `dreamina-video-sync` as plugin-local skills |
| `0.6.0` | Any MCP client with stdio support | `dreamina` CLI installed from the official installer and enrolled | 3.13 | 22 tools registered; local production dispatch verified |
| `0.6.0` | Codex / Claude Code / ZCode / Kimi through `JudgePort` | same | 3.13 | Visual contracts and allowance gates verified; real paid canary remains separately approved or `NOT_RUN` |

The paid canary gate is recorded separately; it is either separately approved or marked `NOT_RUN`. Runtime gate lines are published and checked by:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_distribution_v7.py --plan-gate
python3 scripts/validate_distribution_v7.py --require-runtime-gates
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 available to the MCP server.
- The `dreamina` CLI, installed from <https://jimeng.jianying.com/cli> and enrolled through the native trust dialog.
- Optional, for the reference-video project tools only: `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, a Whisper-compatible ASR runtime, and macOS `say`.

### From the plugin marketplace

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add full-aigc-plugins/dreamina-design-plugin --ref v0.7.0
codex plugin add dreamina-design@partme-ai-dreamina-design
```

Restart Codex or the ChatGPT desktop app, then open a new task so the MCP server starts and the Skills load.

### Confirm it loaded

```bash
codex plugin list
```

Expected entry:

```text
dreamina-design@partme-ai-dreamina-design  installed, enabled
```

Then confirm the MCP server is registered and the CLI is trusted:

```bash
codex mcp list
```

Ask Codex to read the CLI status and account readiness. The read-only tools run without a prompt; the paid tools raise a native confirmation.

### China mirror (AtomGit)

If GitHub is slow or unreachable, install from the AtomGit mirror instead. The
commands are identical apart from the marketplace URL:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://atomgit.com/partme-ai/partme-dreamina-design.git --ref main
codex plugin add dreamina-design@partme-ai-dreamina-design
```

To install the whole partme-ai plugin catalog from the mirror in one step:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://atomgit.com/partme-ai/plugins.git
codex plugin add dreamina-design@partme-ai-dreamina-design
```

Notes:

- The AtomGit source and the GitHub source share marketplace names, so adding
  one replaces the other. Switch back with
  `codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/partme-ai/plugins.git`.
- For ZCode or Kimi, clone the mirror repository and register the local
  directory in the respective marketplace configuration.

## Quick start

### 1. Enrol the CLI once

The first tool call that needs the CLI asks you to confirm the binary's absolute path and digest in a native dialog whose default action is Cancel.

### 2. Create an image

```text
Create a Dreamina image from this brief: a matte ceramic teapot on a linen table, soft morning light.
```

Expected observation: a capability snapshot, a validated request, a native confirmation with the exact parameters, then a single submission with a `submit_id`.

### 3. Query and download

```text
Query that task and download the result.
```

Expected observation: the task is queried by `submit_id` and the artifact is verified on arrival. If the result is still pending, the plugin reports the state instead of resubmitting.

## Configuration

| Setting | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| MCP server | `.mcp.json` | stdio; startup timeout 10s, tool timeout 3600s |
| Tool approval mode | `.mcp.json` | `approve` for read-only tools, `prompt` for paid and mutating tools |
| Trusted CLI record | `~/.config/dreamina-design/trusted-cli.json` | File mode `0600`, directory mode `0700`; stores the path and digest |
| State root | `~/.local/share/dreamina-design/` | Holds `operations/` and `approvals/` |
| CLI diagnostics | `~/.dreamina_cli/logs` | Read through the bounded, redacted diagnostic tool |
| Environment passed through | `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `PATH` | Declared in `.mcp.json` |

## MCP tools

### Read-only tools, auto-approved

| Tool | Purpose |

### Paid or mutating tools, requiring a native confirmation

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dreamina_cli_install_or_upgrade` | Install or upgrade from the fixed HTTPS installer |
| `dreamina_auth` | OAuth login, check, relogin, or logout |
| `dreamina_submit_image` | Submit one approved paid image request |
| `dreamina_submit_video` | Submit one approved paid video request |
| `dreamina_visual_loop` | Drive a visual-quality loop: lock a target, run one approved paid round, record the host's independent judgement, retry once at most under an exact-fingerprint allowance |
| `dreamina_session` | Create, list, search, rename, or delete a Session |
| `dreamina_video_project` | Create, inspect, list, or resume a video project and enrol media tools |
| `dreamina_analyze_reference_video` | Seed a source video and derive frames, sheets, and a recut |
| `dreamina_validate_shot_analysis` | Persist semantic shot annotations |
| `dreamina_create_redesign` | Create a creative-design version, original or authorized replication |
| `dreamina_approve_video_batch` | Activate one non-expandable whole-batch allowance after native confirmation |
| `dreamina_execute_video_batch` | Run, reconcile, or resume an activated batch |
| `dreamina_evaluate_video_batch` | Record measured and semantic gates for one shot attempt |
| `dreamina_compose_video` | Build a closed timeline and render a temporary final MP4 |
| `dreamina_export_video_project` | Verify the rendered MP4 and export it to an approved destination |

### Visual quality-loop contracts

- `VisualTargetReceipt` locks the target bytes, dimensions, source and approved roots before generation.
- `VisualRoundReceipt` binds the paid request fingerprint, returned artifact, independent Judge evidence, score, blocking gaps and next action.
- `JudgePort` is host-neutral: Codex, Claude Code, ZCode, Kimi or another MCP host supplies the evaluator adapter; business code does not import a Codex sub-agent API.
- A failed first round stops at `awaiting_approval`. It does not submit again. The default loop allows one retry only after an allowance matching both the exact retry fingerprint and its credit ceiling is activated.
- `ReplanPort` may propose a repair without spending credits. The proposal must be persisted, approved by exact fingerprint and credit ceiling, and only explicit `max_attempts=3` loops can use a third round.
- Video batch evaluation uses verified keyframe anchors and `VideoEvaluationService`. `CompanionDccPreviewPort` connects the existing Blender/Maya argv+JSON handoff to the same Judge and receipt chain and fails closed when no companion is configured.

### Error envelope

Failures return a structured envelope: `error_type`, `message`, `retryable`, `requires_user_action`, and `next_action`. `next_action` is one of `request_user_action`, `query_same_submit_id`, or `correct_request`.

## Retry, idempotency, and recovery

- Unknown results are queried by `submit_id`; submissions are never blindly retried.
- An ambiguous submission consumes its reservation and enters manual review rather than retrying.
- Visual first-round evaluation cannot create a second paid request; a retry requires an active exact-fingerprint allowance and cannot exceed its approved credit ceiling.
- Approval receipts are single-use, expire after five minutes, and are bound to the session and request.
- Task status strings are normalized, so `querying`, `queued`, `pending`, `processing`, `running`, and `generating` all report as `querying`.
- Terminal operation states are `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.
- Local upload inputs are contained by `scripts/reference_policy.py`: at most 50 MiB per image and 512 MiB per media file, with type and containment checks.

## Data and state

| Data | Location | Lifecycle | Secrets |
|---|---|---|---|
| Operation receipt | `~/.local/share/dreamina-design/operations/` | Until you delete it | No; identifiers, hashes, states, timestamps |
| Approval receipt | `~/.local/share/dreamina-design/approvals/` | Five minutes or single use | No; credential-like keys are stripped before persistence |
| Trusted CLI record | `~/.config/dreamina-design/trusted-cli.json` | Until you re-enrol or delete it | No; path and digest only |
| Downloaded artifacts | Your chosen destination | Until you delete them | No |

## Security

- Authentication stays with the `dreamina` CLI; this repository does not store credentials.
- Every paid or mutating call passes a native confirmation dialog whose default action is Cancel.
- CLI trust requires an absolute, non-symlink path, a trusted owner and mode, and a SHA-256 digest.
- Approval persistence strips credential-like keys and rejects account-snapshot keys before writing anything.
- Tool invocations use argv arrays only; no tool accepts a free-form command string.
- Diagnostics are bounded and redacted; logs are never dumped wholesale.

## Development and verification

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_distribution.py .
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Additional gates:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_distribution_v7.py --require-runtime-gates
python3 scripts/verify_skill_snapshot.py --strict
python3 scripts/run_strict_trace.py
python3 scripts/unlock_runtime_gates.py status
```

Recorded evidence:

- [Offline verification](docs/verification/offline.md) and the reference-video runtime record `docs/verification/reference-video-runtime-2026-09-14.md`. The ten reference-video gate lines are recorded `NOT_RUN`.
- [Skill discovery](docs/verification/skill-discovery.md) and [strict TRACE](docs/verification/skill-trace.md).
- [Authorization decision record](docs/verification/authorization-decision.md) and the paid canary records.
- [CLI runtime](docs/verification/dreamina-cli-runtime.md), plus the recorded CLI help, schema, and digest.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check first | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Tools are missing | `codex mcp list` | Confirm the plugin is enabled and open a new task |
| A paid call is blocked | The confirmation dialog | Confirm explicitly; the default action is Cancel |
| The CLI is not trusted | The trust record | Re-enrol the CLI and confirm the digest |
| A task looks stuck | The task state | Query by `submit_id`; do not submit again |
| A login is required | Account readiness | Use the authentication tool, then retry the read-only check |
| A video mode is refused | Web-side prerequisites | Complete the prerequisite on the web; the plugin reports rather than bypasses it |
| A reference-video tool does nothing | The runtime gate record | Those tools are recorded `NOT_RUN` until the gate passes |
