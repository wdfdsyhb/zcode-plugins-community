# Paid-action authorization status

## Current state

- request fingerprint and displayed scope binding: implemented
- five-minute maximum local approval lifetime: implemented
- random opaque approval ID: implemented
- atomic single-use consumption: implemented and concurrency-tested
- caller-supplied raw approval dictionary accepted by submit: prohibited
- trusted human approval issuer from Codex UI/MCP: implemented through paid MCP tools with `approval_mode: prompt`
- paid canary: **APPROVED and completed** (`bff07abc-a2f6-473b-b53d-38c7bd7b492c`)

`record_approval()` is not exposed as the production entry point. The paid MCP
tool call is gated by the Codex product confirmation prompt; after acceptance,
the handler derives the exact scope and issuer internally, issues a random
maximum-five-minute approval ID, and consumes it once in the same workflow.

The full canary evidence is recorded in `paid-canary-2026-09-13.md` and
`paid-canary-approved.md`.
