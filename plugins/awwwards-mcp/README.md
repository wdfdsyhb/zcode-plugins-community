# awwwards-mcp

Free, open-source MCP server that gives AI agents design inspiration from
[Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) — the Mobbin-style visual reference loop,
sourced from the web's best award-winning websites.

[![M8ven Score](https://m8ven.ai/badge/mcp/insane0777-awwwards-mcp-12ujax?v=2)](https://m8ven.ai/mcp/insane0777-awwwards-mcp-12ujax?s=readme)

Your agent searches in natural language ("dark 3D portfolio sites", "soft pastel
e-commerce"), sees **real screenshots inline**, and can pull the **design DNA**
of any site: color palette, tech stack, design elements, award history.
Free-text queries run on a porter-stemmed, prefix-matching FTS5 index with BM25
ranking — "magazines" now finds Magazine-tagged sites (68 on the live index),
best matches first, where the old substring path returned zero. Multi-word
queries keep AND semantics: every token must hit the same site.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `search_sites` | Search by color, tags, technology, award type or free-text query. Multi-word queries match against the local FTS5 index and rank BM25 (title hits lead); zero results come with loose-match and taxonomy-tag hints. Default full results include each site's screenshot; use `responseMode: "compact"` for concise cards and inline previews of only the first two results on the requested page. |
| `get_site_details` | Full design DNA for one site: palette, technologies, elements, awards, description. |
| `compare_sites` | Compare 2–3 sites' design DNA and jury scores as text-only JSON. Uses cached details or fetches missing detail pages. |
| `get_index_status` | Read local index count, crawl progress, last success/error, lock state and freshness without network requests. |
| `get_site_elements` | Component-level visuals for one site: each element's poster image inline (3D models, video content, mobile layouts, microcopy…) + video URLs. |
| `list_categories` | Every filter the agent can search by (200+ tags, 27 colors). |
| `capture_live_site` | Optional: fresh full-page screenshot of any live URL. Waits for `load` + a settle window with a bounded pre-scroll, so heavy sites work (`waitStrategy: "networkidle"` available). Pass `viewport: "mobile"` for the 390×844 iPhone-class render (`"desktop"` 1440×900 default). (needs [playwright](https://playwright.dev)). |
| `analyze_page_structure` | Section band map of any page (live URL or local file:// build): tag, background, offset, height per band. Compare a reference site's structure against your build. Same heavy-site-friendly wait (`waitStrategy: "networkidle"` available); `viewport: "mobile"` analyzes the phone-class layout (`"desktop"` default). (needs [playwright](https://playwright.dev)). |
| `record_site_motion` | Optional: short motion-through video of a live URL — preloader, scroll-triggered and hover/cursor animations. Returns an inline filmstrip JPEG plus the saved .webm path. `viewport: "mobile"` records at phone size — the filmstrip renders at the selected viewport, no pillarboxing (`"desktop"` default). (needs [playwright](https://playwright.dev) + ffmpeg-static). |
| `search_elements` | Search the inspiration-elements gallery (footer, hero, pricing, 404…) by free text; ranks BM25 over title/author/category. |
| `get_element` | One element record: title, category, author, built-with stack, related elements and its media URL (image or video) pointing at awwwards' CDN. |
| `get_motion_dna` | Runtime motion fingerprint of a live URL: animation libraries, render engines, ScrollTrigger stats (trigger count, scrub ratio), tween easing/duration vocab and the scroll model. Fresh capture or cached capture with timestamp. |
| `search_motion` | Search previously captured motion-DNA scans by library, scroll model or easing vocabulary — find references by how a site moves. |
| `new_winners` | Poll today's freshly-crowned winners (SOTD / Developer Award / Honorable Mention) against a persisted baseline. First call seeds and dumps the listing; later calls report the delta. Each first-seen winner's Elements section is backfilled into the searchable element corpus, so new winners are element-searchable immediately. |
| `watch_site` | Persistent watches over studios, tags or specific sites (add/list/remove). `list` matches each watch against the freshest cached listing and reports per-watch `NEW since last check` deltas — it never fetches; `new_winners`/`search_sites` keep the pool fresh. |

**Data posture**: element records store metadata + media URLs pointing at
awwwards' own CDN — nothing is mirrored. Motion DNA records are local
captures, each stamped with the time it was taken.

## Setup

**v1.0.0** — the first stable release. Any MCP-compatible coding agent can use awwwards-mcp — no API key, no account.
Requires Node ≥ 22.13 (`node -v` to check). Pick your agent:

**Updates**: the server checks the npm registry once a day and prints an
stderr notice when a newer `awwwards-mcp` exists (stdout stays clean for the
JSON-RPC channel — your agent sees the notice as a log line). Set
`AWWWARDS_AUTO_UPDATE=1` in the server's `env` to opt into background
self-update; restart your agent afterwards to load it. Nothing is fetched
more than once a day and serving never waits on the check.

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add awwwards -- npx -y awwwards-mcp
```

**Codex CLI** (ChatGPT desktop app and the IDE extension share this config)

```bash
codex mcp add awwwards -- npx -y awwwards-mcp
```

or in `~/.codex/config.toml` (project-scoped: `.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.awwwards]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "awwwards-mcp"]
```

**OpenCode** (`opencode.json` — note the command is an array)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "awwwards": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "awwwards-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**ZCode** (`~/.zcode/cli/config.json` — note servers nest under `"mcp": { "servers": ... }`)

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "awwwards": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "awwwards-mcp"], "env": {} }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf / Gemini CLI / Cline / Continue** — anything
reading the common `mcpServers` JSON shape (e.g. `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
or `~/.gemini/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awwwards": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "awwwards-mcp"] }
  }
}
```

**Anything else** — awwwards-mcp is a plain stdio MCP server: point your client
at `npx -y awwwards-mcp` and it works. To pin a version, use
`npx -y awwwards-mcp@1.0.0`.

**pi coding agent** has no built-in MCP by design — it uses skills and
extensions instead. Two options:

1. Install the awwwards-inspiration skill (below). pi reads skills from
   `~/.pi/agent/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/` (the latter is shared across
   agents following the Agent Skills standard). The skill teaches the workflow;
   for it to reach the live data, add an MCP-supporting pi extension, or run
   the queries in another agent and paste results.
2. Skip MCP entirely: ask pi to build you a small CLI wrapper around
   awwwards.com, or use a shared skills directory (`~/.agents/skills/`) so the
   same skill file serves pi and every other agent.

Optional full-page captures (needed by `capture_live_site`,
`analyze_page_structure`, `record_site_motion`):

```bash
npm install -g playwright && npx playwright install chromium
```

`record_site_motion` additionally uses ffmpeg; it resolves the `ffmpeg-static`
package automatically if present.

## Skills

This package ships four agent skills. Any agent that follows the
[Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) can load them; copy them into
your agent's skills directory:

```bash
npm install awwwards-mcp
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills && cp -r node_modules/awwwards-mcp/skills/awwwards-inspiration node_modules/awwwards-mcp/skills/awwwards-setup node_modules/awwwards-mcp/skills/awwwards-doctor node_modules/awwwards-mcp/skills/awwwards-motion-study ~/.agents/skills/
```

| Skill | What it teaches |
|-------|-----------------|
| `awwwards-setup` | First-time onboarding: asks the user's preferences (result density, viewport, captures, local index, winner watches), persists them to `~/.awwwards-mcp/preferences.json`, and runs any one-time installs they opt into. |
| `awwwards-inspiration` | The inspiration loop: search, judge from screenshots, pull design DNA, state a design direction, capture/motion-first builds; staying current with `new_winners` and `watch_site`. |
| `awwwards-motion-study` | The full video chain: what to record from a live site (and what to skip), frame-by-frame review (video input or tile-per-element), the motion inventory, and build verification by re-recording. |
| `awwwards-doctor` | Repair: run `npm run doctor`, apply its fixes, re-anchor parsers after real awwwards.com drift, recover the in-flight task that surfaced the failure. |

| Agent | Skills directory |
|-------|------------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| pi | `~/.pi/agent/skills/` (also reads `~/.agents/skills/`) |
| ZCode | `~/.zcode/skills/` |
| Agent Skills-standard agents | `~/.agents/skills/` |

Windows: run this from Git Bash, or copy
`node_modules\awwwards-mcp\skills\awwwards-setup` manually.

## Indexing (recommended)

`search_sites` works out of the box, but its depth is limited by polite live
scraping (~31 sites per filter page). Build a local index once and searches
draw from thousands of award-winning sites instantly:

```bash
npx -y -p awwwards-mcp awwwards-index      # once published
# or, from a local checkout of this repo:
npm run index
```

- Crawls all ~200 tag pages at 1 request/second (~4 minutes) into the local
  SQLite cache at `~/.awwwards-mcp/`.
- Resumable: interrupt it and re-run — completed pages are skipped.
- The MCP server re-indexes automatically in the background whenever the
  index is older than 7 days (never blocking your session). Completed crawl
  checkpoints are cleared so each refresh actually revisits the tag pages.
  Run `get_index_status` to inspect progress or the last crawl error.

### Elements index (optional)

The `search_elements` tool auto-indexes the first gallery page (~48 items)
on first use. To build a full corpus (~1,500+ items, ~15 pages at 48/page):

```bash
npm run index -- --elements all     # follow pagination until exhausted
npm run index -- --elements 10      # first 10 listing pages
```

Any crawl beyond the first page also runs the **taxonomy pass**: every
facet page (`/elements/footer/`, `/elements/cta/`, … 46 categories) is
fetched once and each element under it is stamped with that category, so
`search_elements`' `category` filter works across the corpus. Element
pages carry no breadcrumb, so this listing-side pass is the only category
source; elements seen on no facet page stay `unsorted`.

Element rows are searched by title, author, category **and slug tokens**
(slug is an FTS5-indexed column; a cache opened from an older schema
version rebuilds its search index automatically on first open). Each
element also carries the slug of the award-winning site it came from
(`siteSlug`/`siteUrl` in `search_elements`/`get_element` results). Two
record sources share this corpus: gallery records (indexed from the public
elements listing) and `source:"site"` records backfilled from each new
SOTD winner's own Elements section by `new_winners` — their slugs are
namespaced `site-<siteslug>-<title>` so the two never collide. The
elements index has the same 7-day freshness gate as the sites index —
a re-run inside the window skips itself.

Site details (palettes, tech stacks) are still fetched on demand and cached
for 7 days. Awwwards page and CDN requests have a 10-second deadline per
attempt, including response-body reading; transient page failures are retried
once, while blocks (403/429) and CDN failures are not retried.

## How it works

- Live, polite scraping of awwwards.com public pages (max 1 request/second,
  robots.txt-compliant paths only, cached 7 days in SQLite at `~/.awwwards-mcp/`).
- Screenshots are served from Awwwards' own CDN (880×660), cached on disk.
- No API key, no account, no cost.

## Ethics & terms

This tool fetches publicly available pages for **personal design-inspiration
use**, at human-ish request rates, honoring robots.txt. Awwwards' screenshots
and content remain the property of Awwwards and the credited creators — don't
bulk-scrape, redistribute, or republish them. If you use this commercially,
review awwwards.com's terms yourself.

## Built with awwwards-mcp: four real sites

Four complete sites were built through the full inspiration loop this MCP
enables, using nothing but the server's tools plus the shipped
`awwwards-inspiration` skill. Each one exercised a different corner of the
loop — and every correction the loop caught on the way became doctrine in the
skill.

> **Built in one shot, by a model that can't watch video.** All three sites
> were built in a single prompt run on **GLM 5.3-flash** — which does not
> support video input. The loop's motion study worked entirely from
> frame-tiled filmstrips (ffmpeg, 1–2 fps per element) instead of watching
> the recordings. With a video-native model, those same `get_site_elements`
> videos and `record_site_motion` .webm files could be watched directly —
> timing, easing and overlap read at full fidelity — and the motion-true
> results would be better still. The skill's frame-tile doctrine is what
> closes that gap today.

*Screen recording of the agent running the `awwwards-inspiration` loop end to
end with the awwwards MCP tools — searching SOTD references with inline
screenshots, pulling design DNA, frame-studying element videos, building, and
verifying with band maps + motion recording. If your client doesn't render
the player, [watch the file directly](assets/demo-loop.mp4).*

**1. [Ridge](showcase/ridge/index.html)**
([source](showcase/ridge/)) — a Swiss-minimal single-page showcase for a fictional engineering-talent studio, direction **Aspen Search** (SOTD + Developer Award, jury 7.48): monochrome `#FAFAF8`/`#1A1A1A` + mint, giant grotesque section markers, halftone grain, asymmetric panel grid, dark discipline panels in an interior **horizontal pin passage**, count-up stats, client rows, theme toggle, cursor-follower. Built with the v1.4.0 toolkit: FTS5-ranked direction search, **both-viewports** reference captures and QA (desktop 7,849px + mobile 390×844), overflow audit (0px both), pin-center shots, film verification — and the skill-memory flywheel recorded the findings. QA evidence: `showcase/ridge/_qa/`.

**The grain-panel hover**, studied from aspensearch.com's recording and rebuilt as a canvas dither-dissolve — dots flip to mint around the mouse, the trail elongates, the boundary dissolves:

![Ridge grain-panel hover — canvas dither-dissolve following the mouse](assets/ridge-dither.gif)

| Panel grid (desktop) | Horizontal discipline passage | Mobile 390×844 |
|---|---|---|
| ![Ridge desktop — Swiss panel grid with mint and grain](assets/ridge-home.jpg) | ![Ridge disciplines — pinned horizontal passage mid-slide](assets/ridge-disciplines.jpg) | ![Ridge mobile — stacked grid, zero overflow](assets/ridge-mobile.jpg) |

**2. [Fallow Press](fallow-press/index.html)**
([source](fallow-press/)) — a flat-2D editorial journal, direction
**Emergence Magazine** (SOTD): pink `#FF9398` on cream and black, torn-paper
masthead (pure CSS `clip-path`, zero WebGL), giant grotesque display over
grayscale photography, serif-italic brand, three pages with **separate
horizontal** projects/about pages (GSAP ScrollTrigger pin +
`containerAnimation`).

| Torn-paper masthead (home) | Horizontal gallery (Fields) | Horizontal chapters (Practices) |
|---|---|---|
| ![Fallow Press home — torn-paper masthead over grayscale photography](assets/fallow-home.jpg) | ![Fallow Press Fields — pinned horizontal gallery panel](assets/fallow-fields.jpg) | ![Fallow Press Practices — pink quote chapter](assets/fallow-practices.jpg) |

The loop as it ran:

1. `search_sites` (magazine filters) → shortlist judged from inline
   screenshots → `get_site_details` on Emergence Magazine.
2. **Capture before building**: `capture_live_site` + `record_site_motion`
   on the live site *first*; full-page PNG and motion .webm kept in
   [fallow-press/ref-motion/](fallow-press/ref-motion/) as the evidence trail.
3. Build, then verify: full-page capture plus **panel-center pin shots** of
   both horizontal pages (13 stops each, in
   [fallow-press/_qa/](fallow-press/_qa/) — `capture-qa.mjs` is reusable).
4. The pin shots caught a real bug: horizontal-panel entrances used
   `toggleActions: "play none none reverse"`, and 100vw panels hide content
   at midpoints on the way back — copy disappeared mid-view. Fix
   (one-shot play entrances) is now doctrine: **full-viewport panels get
   one-shot entrances**; QA pin shots land at panel **centers**, not uniform
   fractions, or you photograph empty transition zones.

**3. Cerebrium recreation** (`C:/Users/Afjal/cerebrium-recreation/`) — a
fidelity-first recreation of cerebrium.ai, pixel-checked against the live
reference: full-page captures of both sides, `analyze_page_structure` band
compare, and SVG icon/legend fixes until the build matched the reference to
within 1px of total page height (10,871px vs 10,870px). This is the
**structure-before-pixels** doctrine at its strictest — band maps compared,
never just totals.

![Cerebrium recreation — full-page build capture](assets/cerebrium-build.jpg)

**4. The Meridian** (`C:/Users/Afjal/editorial-site/`) — an editorial journal
built from ORDR/Hearst references: the first build to run the whole loop
end-to-end. `analyze_page_structure` caught a masthead band bug by comparing
the build's band map against the reference's; the reference captures,
motion film, and the reusable pre-scroll capture script live in
`editorial-site/_qa/`.

## Skills used to build these

| Skill | Role in the builds |
|---|---|
| `awwwards-inspiration` | The 8-step loop itself (ships with this package): search → judge from screenshots → design DNA → capture/motion study → state direction → build → band-map verify. |
| `gsap-scrolltrigger` | The horizontal pin + `containerAnimation` pattern (ease `"none"`, one-shot entrances) driving both Fallow Press horizontal pages. |
| `gsap-core` / `gsap-timeline` | Tween composition and sequenced hero entrances (torn-paper drop, panel copy rises). |
| `frontend-design` | Typography, palette and layout judgment applied when translating reference DNA into original pages. |
| `lenis` (library, via skill guidance) | smooth scrolling synced to ScrollTrigger on the Fallow Press home page. |
| `tailwindcss` / plain CSS | All builds are plain hand-rolled CSS — flat 2D, no frameworks needed. |

**The skills self-improve:** every loop pass records what verification caught (`scripts/skill-memory.mjs record`), and a deterministic distiller folds rules seen 2+ times into your installed skill copy — while the shipped copies only change via human PR. A techniques registry (`skills/_memory/techniques.json`) catalogs researched how-tos per domain (video understanding, motion detection, UI structure, micro-interactions, images).

Reduced-motion, JS-less visits, and capture tools all get graceful fallbacks
(vertical stacks; progressive-enhancement reveals).

**What the verification loop caught** — proof the structure-before-pixels
doctrine is load-bearing:

- Element **posters lie**: the first showcase build was designed from poster
  frames alone and rendered a spinning 3D ring as *floating static cards*.
  Downloading the element videos (`get_site_elements`) and frame-tiling them
  revealed the motion truth — now the skill mandates studying motion before
  animating.
- Full-page captures of reveal-on-scroll builds showed blank sections: `.reveal`
  animation state vs capture's no-scroll reality. Builds ship
  content-visible-without-JS progressive enhancement.
- Horizontal-panel copy vanished **mid-view** on the Fallow Press pages:
  `toggleActions` reverse reverts entrances while a 100vw panel is still
  holding the viewport (see above).
- Band-map compare kept the references' rhythm instead of drifting on
  section heights (Cerebrium, The Meridian).

Prompt counts: **3** for the original showcase build (the build ask, the
motion correction that exposed the poster-lie, the structure pass) and
**1** for Fallow Press ("create a new website using our MCP and skills… no
3D websites") — its two follow-ups were caught by the QA loop, not by the
user. Each correction became doctrine in the shipped `awwwards-inspiration`
skill: frame-study element videos before animating; judge page architecture
from the studied passages; tile per element, not one giant filmstrip;
capture live sites and animation **before** building.

## Can awwwards-mcp crawl the sitemap? (robots.txt notes)

The awwwards.com `robots.txt` advertises
`Sitemap: https://www.awwwards.com/sitemap.xml` and — verified live
2026-09-18 — **that sitemap URL returns a soft-404 HTML page** (as do common
child names like `/sitemap-websites.xml`). So sitemap discovery isn't
currently a path to more data; the polite crawl surface is exactly what the
indexer uses:

- **Allowed and used**: `/websites/`, `/websites/<filter>/`, `/sites/<slug>`
  (one filter per URL; deep pagination stays un-crawled).
- **Disallowed and never fetched**: `/tag/`, `/search-websites`,
  `/websites/?` (query-string pagination), `/elements/*`, `/vote/`,
  favourites/likes/follows, and the rest of the 33 rules.
- Our client (`src/awwwards.ts` `buildFilterUrl`) constructs **only**
  `/websites/…` paths at 1 request/second — the loop stays inside the
  published rules by construction, not by convention.

## Contributing

PRs welcome! The project especially needs **parser-drift fixes** — when live
awwwards.com markup changes, a fresh HTML snapshot attached to an issue often
becomes the new test fixture and the fastest merged PR. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide:

**Parser-drift is monitored automatically.** A probe script
([scripts/parser-drift-probe.mjs](scripts/parser-drift-probe.mjs),
`npm run drift`) checks every markup anchor the parsers depend on — the
`split`/`indexOf`/regex literals in `src/parsers.ts` — against the live
listing and detail pages (2 fetches, 1 request/second, same politeness as
the client). A daily GitHub Action ([.github/workflows/parser-drift.yml](.github/workflows/parser-drift.yml))
runs it and, on drift, opens/updates a single tracking issue with the exact
anchors that changed (and auto-closes it when a later run is green). To run
it yourself: `npm run drift` (live, exit code 0/1/2) or `npm run drift -- --fixture`
(offline, checks the committed fixtures still feed every anchor). Raw HTML
is never diffed or stored — anchors only fire when the parsers actually
break, so there are no false alarms from cosmetic tweaks.

- Development setup & project layout (offline fixture-tested, no network in tests)
- How to create a PR: fork → `fix/`/`feat/`/`docs/` branch → typecheck + tests → PR template
- The politeness constraints new code must keep (1 req/s, robots.txt paths, light runtime deps)
